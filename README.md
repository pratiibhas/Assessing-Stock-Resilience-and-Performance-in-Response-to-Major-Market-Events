# Assessing Stock Resilience and Performance in Response to Major Market Events: An Event Based Analysis

### Summary of Notebooks :
1. Major events - A collection of csv files with timelines and major events happened in India and globally , we will not use it directly but it gives us a bird's eye view, that which event we should focus on while scraping the data.
2. NIFTY 50 - A collection of csv files about the NIFTY 50 across the year 2018- 2025 (present), these csv files include OHLC Data as well as Turnover and Volumes.
3. NIFTY 50 companies - A list of companies that are the part of NIFTY 50 along with their weight in the NIFTY 50.
4. Initial_analysis.ipynb - A jupyter notebook which performs primary analysis also captures the datepoints where certain patterns were formed (.i.e.Doji. Hammer etc.)

   
### Data collection
- **Stock data** from NSDL's Official website 
- **Articles scraped** from various news articles available on web (Ongoing).

### Additional concepts (Ongoing)
- Building a Text Summarizer from scratch that provides a custome application, where it doesn't just only summarizer also  categorize it as negative or positive and also highlights which area it affected a lot .i.e.India, World, Stock market etc.
