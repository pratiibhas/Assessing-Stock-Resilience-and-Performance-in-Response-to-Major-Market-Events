1/30/2020,India’s first coronavirus infection confirmed in Kerala,"Student from Thrissur district was studying in Wuhan; her condition is stable.India, on Thursday, reported its first positive case of the novel coronavirus (nCoV) from Kerala with a student, who was studying in Wuhan University and had travelled to India, testing positive for the virus.","Kerala, India",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/indias-first-coronavirus-infection-confirmed-in-kerala/article61638034.ece
3/4/2020,"""Wasn't Easy To Remain Isolated,"" Recalls India's 1st Coronavirus Patient","India's first coronavirus patient from Kerala - fully recovered after 39 days of isolation - has emerged stronger and more resilient after a long fight against the disease, which has killed over 3,000 people across the world, infected more than 90,000. ""It was not easy to remain isolated for so long but the counselors regularly called me, paying attention to my mental health,"" says the 20-year-old - a third year-student at a state-run university in Wuhan city of China, epicentre of coronavirus outbreak. ""The moment I had tested positive (on January 30), I called all my friends who traveled with me and I asked them to get in touch with health officials. The health officials called up later to inform of their well-being,"" she recounts the overwhelming experience.

""Doctors and officials came to me and asked for all details - the flight I had boarded, my seat number, details about people who had traveled with me,"" she says. The 20-year-old shares that she prepared herself mentally to fight the infection. ""I had heard of people in China who had recovered from the infection and I knew I was physically doing fine. Kerala Health Minister KK Shailaja called my mother and spoke to her, reassuring her,"" she says, while speaking to NDTV.

""It was just not easy to remain isolated for such a long period, even after returning home. But there were counselors who were regularly calling and speaking to me, paying attention to my mental health... that helped me a lot,"" the medical student adds, expressing gratitude for the support system that developed around her. On January 13, when Wuhan university had closed for a four-week vacation, she hadn't anticipated the outbreak. ""Everything seemed normal on the streets. By January 17, people on the streets were wearing masks and then the situation quickly worsened,"" she says.

""Our holiday was for only four weeks. In June, we have a longer holiday and I thought, considering the airfare, that I would go to India then,"" she recalls.

""But as the situation worsened, we booked tickets for January 23. We had to fly out from Kunning to Kolkata because flight services were already restricted. On January 22, we got information from our seniors that the airports are going to be shut. We immediately went to the airport to get a connecting flight to Kunning. Amid the delay, we took a train instead,"" the student from Thrissur adds. Recalling stringent checks at every point, she adds: ""At every point, there were checks in China. While exiting the university, our body temperatures were taken. Similarly at the airport, railway stations, similar procedures were followed,"" the survivor adds. Around 20 Indian students, travelling together from Wuhan, reached Kolkata on January 23. Next day, some of them flew to Kerala.

""I had got a message from the Indian embassy in a group, asking us to get in touch with nearest health officials after returning to India. I informed our health centre of my arrival on January 25. I was getting calls everyday from the officials who were checking on me and things seemed normal. By January 27, I had developed an itch in my throat. I immediately informed them. They sent for an ambulance and admitted me to a general hospital. My mother accompanied me,"" the young woman remembers the start of her ordeal.

After she was admitted in the isolation room, her samples were sent for tests with those of four others. The results for others were negative. ""But nothing was told to me. I started getting suspicious and by January 30, I came across reports that a Thrissur-based student has tested positive for coronavirus. Soon, a team of doctors and nurses came and met me. They spoke to me in detail,"" she explains.

After all the medical care, when India's first patient tested negative in one of the subsequent tests, she says was not informed about it. ""I was only informed that I have recovered and tested negative for coronavirus after the second consecutive test result as a precautionary measure,"" she recalls.

On February 20, the woman was discharged but was told to be under home quarantine for 14 days.

Like many other students from Wuhan, she is not clear about her return to China. The university was supposed to have opened on February 15 after the four-week break.

""There are 65 students in our class, of which around 45 are Indians. All of us are attending classes online right now. It's a special provision, considering the impact of outbreak in China and beyond. We will return to Wuhan only once we have official sanction to do so,"" the student clarifies.

India has reported 28 coronavirus cases since its first. Of these, 25 cases were reported in the last three days, which includes 16 Italian tourists. All three patients from Kerala - including the 20-year-old - have recovered.The novel coronavirus spreads through contact with droplets spread during coughing and sneezing, doctors say. Besides keeping contact to a minimum with an infected person, the preventive measures include frequent washing of hands and use of hand sanitisers. Fresh tissues should be used while sneezing and coughing and then discarded, to ensure the virus does not spread.",India,https://www.ndtv.com/kerala-news/how-india-first-coronavirus-patient-from-kerala-fought-illness-recovered-2189818

24/3/2020,PM Modi announces 21-day lockdown as COVID-19 toll touches 12,"NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday announced a complete lockdown of the entire country for 21 days in an unprecedented drastic measure to try halt the spread of the pandemic. Shortly after the announcement, the Centre said all road, rail and air services will remain suspended during this period. In his second address to the nation in less than a week on the growing concerns over COVID-19, PM Modi said the lockdown will be in force from Tuesday midnight, as he announced a Central allocation of Rs 15,000 crore to strengthen the health infrastructure to tackle the disease. Fears over the spread of the disease have already led the governments in the states and union territories to clamp a lockdown till March 31—the date till which road, rail and air services have been suspended. However, freight movement will continue to carry essential commodities across the country, officials said.According to 6-page guidelines released by the Ministry of Home Affairs, fair price shops and those dealing with food, groceries, fruits, vegetables, dairy, meat, fish and animal fodder will remain open. The guidelines also stipulated that making false claim to get any relief during lockdown may result in imprisonment up to two years.""To save India, to save every Indian, there will be a complete ban on people from stepping outside their houses from 12 midnight today,"" he said, and showed a poster saying corona means 'Koi Road Par Na Nikle' (No one should come out on roads).""Lockdown is being imposed on every state, union territory, district, village, mohalla and street.”
The lockdown will be like ‘curfew' and more stringent than the 'janta curfew', which was observed on Sunday where millions across the country stayed indoors.
PM Modi folded his hands a few times to emphasise his request to citizens to adhere to his call, saying it is applicable to everyone from the prime minister to a citizen in a village.
""If we don't handle these 21 days well, then our country, your family will go backwards by 21 years,"" he said, asserting that the tough measure is necessary for a decisive battle against the coronavirus outbreak. “One step outside can make way for coronavirus into your house”.
Coronavirus outbreak: Complete coverage
Acknowledging that the decision will have an economic cost, Modi said saving people's lives is of the paramount interest to his government.
He also made a vigorous push for enforcing social distancing as the only way to tackle the coronavirus amid incidents of people violating the lockdown conditions in several parts of the country.
Experts and the experience of countries fighting the deadly virus make it clear that social distancing is the only way to combat the disease, he asserted.
“Social distancing not only for infected but for every citizen including the prime minister.”
“I have full faith that we will emerge victorious from this challenge, “ he said, as he asked people to take care of themselves and their family.
Addressing fears that there could be a shortage of essential commodities and medicines, the prime minister said there is absolutely no need to panic. “Centre and states will work together to ensure availability of essential commodities, medicines...”",India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pm-modi-announces-21-day-nationwide-lockdown-to-combat-coronavirus/articleshow/74797423.cms
1/13/2020,Taal volcano eruption: Philippines alert level raised as thousands flee ash clouds,"Lava has gushed out of a volcano in the Philippines after a sudden eruption of ash and steam that forced villagers to flee and shut down the country’s main airport, offices and schools.Clouds of ash were blown more than 62 miles (100km) north of the Taal volcano, reaching the bustling capital, Manila, and forcing the the main international airport to close and cancel more than 500 flights.

There have been no reports of casualties or major damage from the eruption that began on Sunday. Police said more than 13,000 villagers had been moved to evacuation centres in the hard-hit province of Batangas and nearby Cavite, but officials expect the number to swell with hundreds of thousands more being brought to safety. The evacuation numbers are likely to be higher as local authorities help displaced people before notifying the national agency that is collating the figures. Some residents could not move out of ash-blanketed villages because of a lack of transport and poor visibility, while others are refusing to leave their homes and farms.

“We have a problem, our people are panicking due to the volcano because they want to save their livelihood, their pigs and herds of cows,” Wilson Maralit, the mayor of Balete town, told DZMM radio. “Were trying to stop them from returning and warning that the volcano can explode again any time and hit them.”

Maralit, whose town lies along the shoreline of Taal Lake, which surrounds the erupting volcano, appealed for troops and additional police to be deployed to stop residents from sneaking back into high-risk areas.

Several planes stranded at the Manila airport might be allowed to take off on Monday once they were cleaned of ash and authorities were sure an easterly shift in ash-laden wind away from the capital would not revert, the airport general manager, Ed Monreal, told a news conference. The airport could not accommodate incoming flights until stranded aircraft had flown out and freed up parking bays, he said.

The aircraft of the president, Rodrigo Duterte, was able to land on Monday after his flight, from his southern Davao city hometown, was delayed on Sunday by the volcanic eruption, his spokesman said.

Taal had been restive for months until it suddenly rumbled back to life on Sunday, blasting steam, ash and pebbles up to nine miles into the sky, according to the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology. Lava spurting from the volcano’s vents on Monday was falling into the lake surrounding the crater.

The government volcano-monitoring agency raised the danger level around Taal three notches to level 4, indicating an imminent hazardous eruption. Level 5, the highest, means a hazardous eruption is under way and could affect a larger area with high-risk zones that would need to be cleared of people, said Renato Solidum, who heads the institute.

María Antonia Bornas, the agency’s chief volcanologist, said Taal spurted fountains of lava early on Monday while its ash and steam ejections slightly eased. “It’s hard to tell when the eruption would stop,” she said, citing the volcano’s similar restiveness in the 1970s that lasted for about four months.

With the ashfall easing on Monday, some residents began to shovel away ash that covered everything from homes to cars and roads in Tagaytay, a popular upland resort city on a ridge that overlooks the small but picturesque volcano. Many of the city’s restaurants and coffee shops, however, were closed.

The volcanology institute reminded the public that the small island where the volcano lay was a permanent danger zone, although fishing villages had existed there for years.

Authorities continued to detect swarms of earthquakes and the slight inflation of portions of the volcano, officials said, advising residents to stay indoors and to wear masks and goggles if they had to go outside.

Public institutions, including schools, in many towns and cities were suspended on Monday, including in Manila, to avoid health risks posed by the ashfall. At least four Batangas towns reported power outages.

6/17/2020,Galwan Valley: China and India clash on freezing and inhospitable battlefield,"A savage brawl between Indian and Chinese forces in the Galwan river valley in Ladakh, a disputed Himalayan border region, has left at least 20 Indian soldiers dead. The world's two most populous nations - with two of the planet's biggest military forces - have been at loggerheads for weeks along their long and contested high-altitude frontier. But the crisis escalated on Tuesday when the number of Indians killed in an extraordinary confrontation soared to 20 - they had died without a single shot being fired. India said both sides suffered casualties. China is yet to confirm its number of dead or injured.The site of the clash was on the de facto border - the Line of Actual Control or LAC - between the two countries. India and China share a border that is more than 3,440km (2,100 miles) long and have overlapping territorial claims.  The Galwan river valley, with its harsh climate and high altitude terrain, lies along the western sector of the LAC and close to Aksai Chin, a disputed area claimed by India but controlled by China. The main causes of death at the altitudes and temperatures found in Ladakh are frost bite, a condition called high altitude pulmonary oedema which occurs when lowlanders ascend rapidly to altitudes higher than 2,500m, and another medical condition called high altitude cerebral oedema, where the brain swells with fluid because of the physiological effects of travelling to a high altitude.
Military experts say that the inhospitable region has traditionally been a peaceful area of the LAC.
So what led to Tuesday's clash - the first in the Ladakh valley since 1962 when China defeated India in their only war?
""The Galwan area has now become a hotspot because it is where the LAC is closest to the new road India has built along the most remote and vulnerable area along the LAC in Ladakh,"" Ajai Shukla, an Indian military expert who served as a colonel in the army, told the BBC in May. China is suspicious of India's construction in the area. The road could boost Delhi's capability to move men and materiel rapidly in case of a conflict.
In May, media reports said Chinese forces had put up tents, dug trenches and moved heavy equipment several kilometres inside what had been regarded by India as its territory.
Soldiers from the two sides earlier clashed on at least two occasions in Ladakh, with stand-offs and scuffles reported at Hot Springs; and Pangong Tso lake to the south.

12/3/2020,India farmers protest: Deadlock continues as talks fail again,"Talks that began on Thursday between Indian government ministers and farmers’ leaders have failed to break the deadlock in a dispute over laws passed earlier this year seeking to deregulate the agriculture sector that have ignited the country’s biggest farm protests in years. Tens of thousands of growers have camped outside the capital, New Delhi, in protest against the laws seeking to rid the sector of procurement procedures and allow farmers to sell to institutional buyers and big international retailers. he farmers, who form a powerful political constituency, fear the laws passed in September could pave the way for the government to stop buying grains at guaranteed prices, leaving them at the mercy of private buyers.

Gurnam Singh, a farmer leader who participated in Thursday’s meeting with the government, told Al Jazeera by phone that they would not compromise on their demands.

“Our demand is simple and straight that all the three laws be revoked and MSP (Minimum Support Price for the crop produce) be guaranteed to farmers and made into a law.”

The next round of talks has been scheduled for Saturday, but Singh said he was not hopeful that they would yield a result.

“The government is talking to us for the sake of talks, not to resolve our issues,” he said.

Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Minister Narendra Singh Tomar called on farmers to end their protests and continue with talks.

“The government will consider giving more legal rights to farmers. MSP will continue, we have assured farmers of MSP,” Tomar said after the meeting. Crucial test
The protests pose a crucial test for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ability to reform India’s vast agricultural sector, which accounts for 15 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) but employs more than half of the country’s 1.3 billion people.

“We are at one of the three border crossings into the Indian capital which are completely closed to traffic. Farmers say they want to continue to create this disruption until the government either repeals three recent farm laws or writes guarantees of minimum prices for their produce into law,” Al Jazeera’s Elizabeth Puranam said.

“And the government is saying that it is going to enter these talks with an open heart, they want to find a solution that is in the interest of farmers but with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s recent comments that these were much-needed reforms that are in the interest of farmers, it’s difficult to see right now how the two sides can find a middle ground.”

Tomar and Trade Minister Piyush Goyal have started discussions with nearly three dozen farmers’ representatives, a government official said.

“We expect the government to pay heed to our demands to repeal the laws detrimental to India’s farming community,” said Joginder Singh Ugrahan, a prominent farmers’ leader.

Earlier on Thursday, Amarinder Singh, the chief minister of Punjab state, from where a large number of the protesters are from, met Home Affairs Minister Amit Shah in the capital.

“Discussion is going on between farmers and centre, there’s nothing for me to resolve. I reiterated my opposition in my meeting with the home minister and requested him to resolve the issue as it affects the economy of my state and security of the nation,” Singh was quoted as saying by the ANI news agency.

Modi’s government has defended the bill and several hours of talks between farmers’ leaders and the government on Tuesday failed to break the impasse.

“We humbly request you to pay heed to the voice of farmers and withdraw completely the implementation of these Acts,” Avik Saha, another farmers’ leader said in a letter written to the agriculture minister on Thursday.

“The issue is not about one particular clause, but about the direction in which the government of India is pushing farming in India,” Saha wrote.

Farm groups say the government is trying to end a decades-old policy of providing them with an assured minimum price for producing staples, such as wheat and rice. Meanwhile, former Punjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal, who was an ally of Modi’s governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) until September, has returned his Padma Vibhushan – the country’s second-highest civilian award – to protest against “the betrayal of the farmers” by the government.

Badal’s Shiromani Akali Dal party broke its alliance with the BJP after the farm laws were passed in September.

“Now we have had around 150 athletes, including Olympic gold medalists, saying they are going to go to the presidential building on Saturday to return their national awards again in solidarity with the farmers,” Al Jazeera’s Puranam said",,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/12/3/india-farmers-protests-govt-resumes-talks-with-farmers
11/30/2020,Indian farmers march on Delhi in protest against agriculture laws,"Hundreds of thousands of Indian farmers have marched upon Delhi and set up vast camps blocking entry to the city in protest at agriculture laws they say will destroy livelihoods. More than 300,000 farmers marched from the states of Punjab and Haryana – on foot and in convoys of tractors – at the weekend to reach the Indian capital for what they described as a “decisive battle” with the central government.

As the farmers reached Delhi, some managed to enter but the majority were stopped by barricades and barbed wire erected by police on major roads into the city. The farmers set up camps along five major roads, building makeshift tents and setting up fires with a view to staying for months if their demands are not met.

Police had used tear gas and water cannons against the marching farmers and ripped up highways to stop tractors and protesters moving forward. However, the Delhi government denied police permission to convert nine stadiums into temporary jails for farmers. “Farmers are not criminals,” the city government said.

The farmers are protesting against a series of agricultural laws that see the deregulation of crop pricing which farmers say will leave them at the mercy of big corporations. The government has argued that the laws are necessary reforms that give farmers more autonomy over the selling of their crops and will break big unfair monopolies.

Though farmers’ unions have been protesting in Punjab for the past two months, holding marches and blocking roads and train lines, they said they were organising the march to Delhi to force the government’s hand. Unions want to repeal the laws, which they say are anti-farmer and pro-corporate interests.

Farming is one of the biggest employers in India, with more than 40% of the population working in agriculture.

Among the farmers who marched to the border was Ratam Mann Singh, 61, from Haryana, who is president of the Indian Farmers Association for the state. He said: “I took part in this protest to the Delhi border because the central government has sold out the farmers with these new laws, which did not have any consultation or input from farmers. If they are passed then the farmers’ rights will be finished.”

Singh said many of the farmers had brought enough food, supplies and blankets to last for up to three months. “We are prepared to stay here for as long as it takes, even in the cold winter, we are ready for that. The farmers of India have been betrayed,” he said.

On Saturday, the union minister, Amit Shah, said the government was willing to deliberate on “every problem and demand” of the farmers. Talks have been scheduled for 3 December.

The farmers’ demands have proved contentious. Among them is the demand to remove a fine for stubble burning, the practice of setting fields alight to remove the old crop. While farmers say it is unavoidable, stubble burning is a major contributor to the toxic air pollution that engulfs Delhi and northern India in the winter months and has been made illegal as a result.

The farmers’ cause has garnered support from across the world, including from the cricketer Monty Panesar and Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi, the UK MP for Slough, who tweeted: “I stand with farmers of the Punjab and other parts of India, including our family and friends, who are peacefully protesting against the encroaching privatisation of Farmers Bill 2020.”",India,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/nov/30/indian-farmers-march-on-delhi-in-protest-against-agriculture-laws

The government also informed that the Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech will begin the trials of nasal coronavirus vaccine once they receive regulatory approval. At present, there is no nasal trial coronavirus vaccine under trial in India. For the trials of the nasal coronavirus vaccine candidate, Bharat Biotech, which is developing an indigenous Covid-19 vaccine in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), has entered into an agreement with Washington University and St. Louis University. In his Sunday Samvaad on Sunday, Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said, ""Bharat Biotech has entered into an agreement with Washington University's School of Medicine under which the company will conduct trials, produce and market an intranasal vaccine for the Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus infection."" He then went on to add that Serum Institute and Bharat Biotech will soon begin the late-stage trials of a nasal coronavirus vaccine candidate in India. Harsh Vardhan said the late-stage trial generally involves thousands of participants, sometimes 30,000 to 40,000.

Of the vaccines currently in Phase 3 trials, all are administered by injection, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).

On Saturday, India's Dr Reddy's Laboratories Ltd and the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) said they have received renewed approval to conduct late-stage clinical trials in India of the Russian coronavirus vaccine, Sputnik V. The DGCI had earlier put a stop on Dr Reddy's Laboratories conducting clinical trials for the Russian coronavirus vaccine Sputnik V, saying the scale of Phase I and II trials of the coronavirus vaccine candidate conducted in Russia was too small.

COVID VACCINE IN INDIA EXPECTED IN NEXT FEW MONTHS: GOVT

Earlier, the government had said that India is expected to have a coronavirus vaccine in a few months. It also said that India should be in the process of delivering the coronavirus vaccine to people in the next six months.

""We are very much into the vaccine development process...in the next few months at the most we should have a vaccine and in the next six months we should be in the process of delivering the vaccine to the people of India,"" he said.

This is just when the World Health Organization said the healthy people might have to wait till 2022 to get a coronavirus or Covid-19 vaccine as health workers and those with a higher risk of contracting the infection will be prioritised.

""Most people agree, it's starting with healthcare workers, and frontline workers, but even there, you need to define which of them are at highest risk, and then the elderly, and so on,"" WHO chief scientist Swaminathan said.

CHINA EXTENDS EMERGENCY USE OF EXPERIMENTAL COVID-19 VACCINE China has stepped up the usage of its coronavirus vaccine to three more cities in East China's Zhejiang Province for an urgent use just days after joining the WHO's 'COVAX' alliance to equitably distribute Covid-19 vaccines across the world.

According to state-run Global Times, the cities of Yiwu, Ningbo and Shaoxing are targeting key groups with urgent need for vaccinations against coronavirus infection following the city of Jiaxing.

1/31/2020,WHO Declares Global Health Emergency As China Coronavirus Kills 213,"The death toll in China from the new coronavirus reached 213 on Friday, with overall cases worldwide rising rapidly in an outbreak that the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a global health emergency. The death toll in Hubei, the Chinese province at the centre of the epidemic, had risen to 204 and there were 9,692 cases of infection nationally as of Thursday, Chinese health authorities said. About 100 cases have been reported in at least 18 other countries, with no deaths outside China.

Even as the WHO said cases had spread to 18 countries, Italy announced its first confirmed cases, in two Chinese tourists.

Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said the government had decided to close all air traffic between Italy and China, a more drastic measure than most countries have undertaken.

Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO director-general, said the organization ""doesn't recommend - and actually opposes"" restrictions on travel or trade with China.

Nonetheless, foreign governments have been flying home their citizens from Hubei and holding them in quarantine, while airlines including Air France , American Airlines and British Airways have stopped flying to mainland China.

Airlines are facing mounting pressure by cabin crew to stop all flights due to unease about exposure to the virus.

Stocks around the world have tumbled on fears of the economic fallout from the outbreak in the world's second-biggest economy.

LOCKDOWN IN WUHAN

Some 60 million people in Hubei province are living under virtual lockdown. 

There had been a further 1,220 cases detected in Hubei by end of Jan. 30, taking the total for the province to close to 6,000, Hubei's health commission said.

Tedros praised China's response in a news conference in Geneva on Thursday evening but said the WHO was declaring a global health emergency because it was concerned about the virus spreading to countries that did not have the resources to deal with it.

""The main reason for this declaration is not because of what is happening in China but because of what is happening in other countries. Our greatest concern is the potential for the virus to spread to countries with weaker health systems,"" he said.

The WHO move will trigger tighter containment and information-sharing guidelines to all countries, but may disappoint Beijing, which had expressed confidence it can beat the ""devil"" virus.

""We are still at a very critical stage in fighting the coronavirus. International solidarity is extremely important and for that purpose all countries should behave in a ... responsible manner,"" Zhang said.",Global,https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/world-health-organization-declares-global-emergency-amid-coronavirus-outbreak-in-china-2172358
2/28/2020,"Europe, US Markets Slump On Virus Fears, Global Slowdown Threat Looms","European and US stock markets slumped painfully again Thursday as new coronavirus infections spread outside China, exacerbating fears of a global slowdown. While the markets in Shanghai and Hong Kong closed higher, Europe and New York saw a sea of red.

London, Frankfurt and Paris all posted losses of more than three percent on the day.

Wall Street also took a beating, with major indices shedding more than four percent in what is shaping up to be the US market's worst week since the 2008 financial crisis.

The Dow shed nearly 1,200 points, or 4.4 percent, taking its losses for the week to more than 11 percent.

Oil prices plunged by more than four percent at one point before recovering somewhat, while the yen gained as traders turned to a traditional haven in times of economic turbulence.

""There was more coronavirus carnage on the markets,"" Spreadex analyst Connor Campbell told AFP.

This is ""one of the worst weeks in recent memory and terrifyingly, it's not over yet,"" he said. ""Friday is a tricky proposition."" Bracing for impact

Around 2,813 people have died worldwide and more than 82,500 have been infected in dozens of countries, raising fears of a pandemic.

US authorities in California said they are monitoring some 8,400 people for the new coronavirus, after officials confirmed a woman had contracted the disease without traveling to any of the outbreak-hit regions.

US President Donald Trump blamed the media coverage of the coronavirus and worries about Democrats winning the White House race for the market plunge.

""The press has been really out of line,"" he said.

Markets also ""see these people"" seeking the Democratic nomination and ""anything could happen in an election.""

If a Democrat wins ""you would have a crash like you've never seen before and I think the market's also putting that into the equation.""

Investors are bracing for the economic impact, with companies including Apple, Microsoft and drinks giant Diageo saying they expect sales to suffer.

Goldman Sachs was the latest on Thursday, slashing its 2020 forecast for US earnings, saying it now expects flat earnings in 2020 and lower growth in 2021.

""It seems that investors concluded that a global pandemic is inevitable, as the outbreaks in South Korea and Europe are getting worse by the day,"" said Gorilla Trades strategist Ken Berman.

President Emmanuel Macron said France was preparing for a surge in the number of cases, adding: ""We are facing a crisis, an epidemic.""

And Denmark and Estonia reported their first cases.

In the United States, Trump on Wednesday sought to ease concerns, telling reporters he did not think it ""inevitable"" that COVID-19 would continue to spread throughout the country, contradicting health officials.

In Japan, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Thursday told schools to close nationwide for several weeks, and Saudi Arabia banned pilgrims from visiting Islam's holiest sites to try to contain the virus.

Shanghai's stock market nonetheless closed slightly higher as the virus appeared to be easing a bit in China as it strengthened in countries such as Iran, Italy and South Korea.

The panic-selling has seen investors rush into haven investments, with the yield on 10-year and 30-year US Treasuries around record lows, while gold prices climbed.

2/24/2020,Stocks fall as coronavirus fears hit global markets,"Financial markets around the globe slumped on Monday as news of the Italian coronavirus outbreak wiped £62bn off the value of the FTSE 100 and shares on Wall Street tumbled.Shares came under heavy selling pressure in key markets as analysts warned that the threat of tougher quarantine measures outside China to prevent the spread of the disease would hit company profits by hitting supply chains and consumer demand. Investors rushed to buy “safe haven” investments such as gold to protect against steep losses on the stock markets, sending the price of the precious metal to a seven-year high of $1,683 (£1,303) an ounce.

US stock markets had their worst day in two years. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by over 1,000 points, or about 3%, in New York as investors in the world’s largest economy priced in the possibility of a deeper global economic shock.

In a note to investors Goldman Sachs cut its US growth forecast from 1.4% to just 1.2% for the first quarter. “An increasing amount of companies [are] suggesting potential production cuts should supply chain disruptions persist into Q2 or later,” wrote Jan Hatzius, Goldman’s chief US economist

The FTSE 100 index in London lost 247 points to 7,156.83, a 3.3% drop and its worst worst percentage fall since January 2016. Among the worst-hit stocks on the list of the UK’s biggest public companies was the budget airline easyJet, which lost £1bn in value as the stock fell by more than 16%. The tour operator Tui fell by almost 10%, and the British Airways owner, IAG, dropped by 9%, on the back of expectations that the outbreak would lead to fewer people jetting away on holiday or for business.

Shares in Carnival, the cruise ship operator that has faced an outbreak of the virus on its Diamond Princess vessel, shed 6.8%.

Seema Shah, chief strategist at investment manager Principal Global Investors, said: “The spread of the virus outside China would mean even more pressure on European supply chains and consumer demand and may result in a wave of profit warnings if the spread accelerates.”

The dramatic plunge in the financial markets comes as Italy emerged at the centre of the coronavirus crisis in Europe, reporting its sixth death on Monday. The number of cases in the country rose to more than 200, the highest number outside Asia. The eurozone’s third largest economy is already shrinking and the rapid spread of the virus has sparked fears of a recession at a delicate moment. Italian authorities have responded by locking down 12 cities in the north of the country and the Venice carnival has been cut short by two days.

The Italian stock market tumbled by almost 1,500 points to 23,288.35, a 6% slide, putting it on track for its worst day since 2016. Elsewhere in Europe, Germany’s Dax index fell 3.5% while France’s Cac 40 lost 3.7%.

In Asia, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index fell 1.8%, while South Korea’s Kospi slumped 3.9%. The number of coronavirus cases rose to 763. Japan’s stock market was closed for a scheduled holiday.

Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at online trading firm IG, said: “It has been a while since the term ‘sea of red’ was last deployed to describe the market action, but it seems appropriate this morning.

“The idea that the coronavirus has been fully contained has been firmly banished, and investors are now on notice to expect more cases and, sadly, more deaths. This means the economic forecasts of the impact, such as they are, will need to be revised, with a greater impact now to be expected.”

Stock markets had fallen sharply at the end of January as news of the coronavirus outbreak first emerged, prompting fears over the global economy because of slowing growth on the back of the US-China trade war. Steps by the People’s Bank of China to inject billions into the world’s second largest economy then led to a rally. However, fresh concerns over the rising impact from the virus have returned to dent optimism.

Oil prices have fallen as global demand is likely to decline because of the virus outbreak and China is the world’s biggest importer of oil. Brent crude tumbled by $2.66 a barrel to $55.69, a 4.6% fall.

Warren Patterson, head of commodity strategy at ING, said: “We believe the virus’s effect on oil demand will shave some 400,000 barrels a day from global consumption growth, taking us to the lowest level in nearly a decade.”

As the virus spreads, the Beijing motor show in late April has been postponed.

11/7/2020,Joe Biden elected 46th President of the United States,"America has chosen Democrat Joe Biden as its 46th president, CNN projects, turning at a time of national crisis to a man whose character was forged by aching personal tragedy and who is pledging to restore calm and truth after Donald Trump’s exhausting and manic single term. In a victory speech Saturday night in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, Biden said he was humbled by the trust America had placed in him and reached out to those Americans who did not vote for him.

“I understand the disappointment tonight. I’ve lost a couple of times myself. But now, let’s give each other a chance,” Biden said. “This is the time to heal in America.” California Sen. Kamala Harris, his running mate, who will make history as the first woman, the first Black person and the first person of South Asian descent to become vice president, noted the significance of her place on the stage Saturday night. Trump, who was on the golf course when CNN and other networks called the race for the former vice president, has shown no indication that he intends to concede. While en route to his course in Virginia, he tweeted: “I WON THIS ELECTION, BY A LOT!”

But Biden supporters – whose face masks reflected the extraordinary circumstances of a pandemic-era election poured into the streets across the country in a moment of catharsis to celebrate the President-elect’s victory.

After four years of Trump’s incessant lies, bullying and vilification of his political opponents, the former vice president said he was running to restore the character of the nation and bring dignity back to the White House. Biden, who turns 78 at the end of this month, will become the oldest president when he is inaugurated in January amid the worst public health emergency in 100 years, the deepest economic slump since the 1930s and a national reckoning on racism and police brutality that is still unresolved.

His election will end Trump’s tumultuous hold on Washington and condemn the Republican, who has had a lifelong obsession with winning, to the ranks of chief executives who lost after a single term.

Former President Barack Obama released a statement that served as testimonial to the character of his former vice president and asked Americans to set aside their political differences and give him a chance.

“When he walks into the White House in January, he’ll face a series of extraordinary challenges no incoming President ever has – a raging pandemic, an unequal economy and justice system, a democracy at risk, and a climate in peril,” Obama wrote. “I know he’ll do the job with the best interests of every American at heart, whether or not he had their vote.”

The former President asked every American to “give him a chance and lend him your support.”

“The election results at every level show that the country remains deeply and bitterly divided,” Obama said. “It will be up to not just Joe and Kamala, but each of us, to do our part – to reach out beyond our comfort zone, to listen to others, to lower the temperature and find some common ground from which to move forward, all of us remembering that we are one nation, under God.”

In a cinematic twist, it was Biden’s boyhood state of Pennsylvania that put him over the 270 electoral vote threshold and delivered the White House. Trump had held a wide lead over Biden on the night of the election, but as election officials counted hundreds of thousands of mail-in ballots, the race shifted dramatically in Biden’s favor, infuriating Trump and his allies, who knew the President’s path to the White House was over without the commonwealth.

“While I may be the first woman in this office, I will not be the last, because every little girl watching tonight sees that this is a country of possibilities,” Harris said.

Earlier in the day, the vice president-elect posted a video on Twitter of her victory call with Biden: “We did it, we did it Joe. You’re going to be the next President of the United State. That the Keystone State was the last hurdle in Biden’s path to the White House was a fitting end to a hard-fought race given that the former vice president has long cultivated his image as “middle-class Joe” from Scranton. In a visit that now seems almost prophetic, he had made a final trip to his childhood home in the city on Election Day after spending much of the campaign promising to prioritize the livelihoods of the many working-class voters whom Hillary Clinton lost to Trump in her 2016 bid.

On one of the living room walls in the house where he grew up, he wrote: “From this House to the White House with the Grace of God,” signing his name and the date,”11.3.2020.”

In the final days of the race, Biden’s team redoubled their efforts to rebuild the Democrats’ “blue wall” – and that gambit paid off with Biden winning Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, according to CNN projections, while holding Minnesota, which the President made a priority in his reelection push.

Biden will also win Nevada, CNN projects, widening his Electoral College lead as ballots continue to be counted around the country. Georgia could head to a recount and votes were still trickling in from Arizona, where Biden is maintaining an edge.

Biden currently holds a 279-214 margin in the Electoral College.

As he watched his hopes of reelection being strangled with each tranche of votes in Pennsylvania, Trump lashed out on Twitter during the tense vote count, attempting to undermine democratic institutions with demands like “STOP THE COUNT.”

The President falsely claimed the election was being stolen from him as many mail-in ballots, which were often counted after Election Day votes, landed in the column of his opponent.

Facing a deeply polarized country, Biden had tried to project comity and patience, and his desire to unite America.

“There will not be blue states and red states when we win. Just the United States of America,” Biden said Wednesday afternoon. “We are not enemies. What brings us together as Americans is so much stronger than anything that can tear us apart.”Part of Trump’s frustration stemmed from the fact that his campaign’s finely tuned ground game did in fact succeed in turning out many more of the so-called “hidden Trump voters” than expected, making the race a much tighter contest than pre-election polls suggested.

Trump continued to cast aspersions on the electoral process – wrongly suggesting that there was something nefarious about the fact that the vote count in key states continued well after Tuesday night, as is customary in US elections.

Meanwhile, his team mounted a series of lawsuits in several states, including Pennsylvania, looking to stop vote counting in some areas while challenging how closely observers can monitor officials counting the votes in others. The Trump campaign also said it would demand a recount in Wisconsin, where Biden led Trump by some 20,000 votes, even though historically a margin of that magnitude is unlikely to be reversed.

 US Presidential Election 2020: Joe Biden, 77, will become the oldest president-elect in US history
Joseph Robinette Biden Jr. has defeated Donald Trump to become the 46th U.S. president, unseating the incumbent with a pledge to unify and mend a nation reeling from a worsening pandemic, faltering economy and deep political divisions.

Biden's victory came after the Associated Press, CNN and NBC showed him winning Pennsylvania and gaining more than the 270 Electoral College votes needed to secure the presidency. Trump sought to undermine the outcome, baselessly accusing Democrats of trying to steal the election and claiming victory before the race was called.

Biden's running mate, California Senator Kamala Harris, 56, becomes the first Black and Indian-American woman to serve as vice president, a glimpse at a coming generational shift in the party.

Biden, 77, will become the oldest president-elect in U.S. history and the first to oust a sitting commander-in-chief after one term since Bill Clinton defeated George H.W. Bush in 1992.


Biden won 284 Electoral College votes, according to the AP, which earlier had called Arizona for the Democrat. Several other networks have yet to call Arizona, leaving Biden with 273 Electoral College votes in their counts, still plenty to claim the presidency.

But the incoming president's goal of uniting the country will be made more difficult by Trump's unfounded allegations of fraud and with control of the U.S. Senate up in the air, awaiting two runoffs in Georgia in January.

If Republicans hold the Senate, Biden's agenda of tax hikes on the wealthy and corporations and climate-friendly energy policies could be stymied in Congress. Democrats maintained control of the House of Representatives.

Biden won back the battleground states of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania -- the so-called Blue Wall that delivered the presidency to Trump in 2016. Buoyed by historic turnout, Biden reaped 4 million more votes than Trump nationwide, as of Saturday morning, winning at least 74 million votes to Trump's 70 million.

Trump Contests the Results

Trump sought to cast doubt on the outcome, claiming widespread voting irregularities without evidence and filing lawsuits to contest the ballot count in some key states where he was behind.

""I WON THIS ELECTION, BY A LOT!"" Trump tweeted Saturday morning. He was at Trump National Golf Club Washington, D.C, in Sterling, Virginia, when the networks called the race for Biden.

So far, none of Trump's lawsuits have gained traction or demonstrated that the results of the election can be overturned.

Biden pulled together enough support to sweep aside one of the most unconventional and polarizing presidents in U.S. history, a man who cultivated a fierce loyalty among his supporters -- they had taken to chanting, ""We love you!"" at his campaign rallies -- while equating his political rivals and the media to enemies of the state.

Given how close Biden's margins were, Trump might have won a second term if not for his widely criticized response to the coronavirus pandemic and the economic fallout. The president routinely mused at rallies how he had the election won before the virus reached the U.S. earlier this year.

Trump consistently downplayed the threat of the virus and discouraged even the simplest public health measures to curb its spread, turning mask-wearing into a political issue. For voters, seeing Trump, his wife and his youngest son infected with Covid-19 in early October punctuated his failure to protect the nation as a whole.

Biden has promised that combating the U.S. outbreak will be his highest priority, along with repairing a battered economy. He has proposed a $3.5 trillion plan that relies heavily on deficit spending to create jobs, though a plan that size likely would face resistance in a Republican-led Senate. More than 9.7 million Americans have been sickened and more than 236,000 have died since February.

The president-elect has said he can erase some of Trump's most controversial decisions on his own, without congressional approval. He plans to rejoin the Paris climate agreement and the World Health Organization and reverse Trump's rollbacks of environmental regulations. He says he will also end the ban on immigration from several predominantly Muslim nations and restore rights for asylum seekers.

Voters responded to Biden's relative humility and his conventional approach to the campaign, which reflected his 47 years in public life. Biden surrounded himself with many of the same advisers from his past campaigns, and his administration likely would include at least some veterans of Barack Obama's White House, where Biden was vice president.

On the airwaves, Americans saw a one-sided contest: In August and September, Biden's campaign and the Democratic National Committee outraised Trump's team by more than $289 million, fueling a massive advertising effort.

Biden Faces GOP Senate

Facing a likely Republican majority in the Senate, Biden would have to draw on longstanding relationships with top Republicans in Congress in order to have any shot of passing major legislation or getting his preferred cabinet confirmed. That could prove difficult in a Washington that looks little like it did when Biden first entered politics in 1972.

The presidency marks an unexpected capstone for Biden's five-decade political career. The former Delaware senator's two previous presidential bids in 1988 and 2008 collapsed in the primaries. After serving as Obama's vice president, he passed up a chance to run again in 2016 following the death of his son Beau Biden and as Democrats coalesced around Hillary Clinton.

Biden entered the Democratic primary in April 2019 as the front-runner. He ran on a message of unity, often saying he ran because of Trump's response to the 2017 White supremacist rally and counter-protest in Charlottesville, Virginia, when the president said there were ""very fine people on both sides.""

Until Biden's victory was assured, Democrats feared he might fall short -- much like Clinton in 2016. Public polls once again appeared to overstate Biden's strength in closely contested states, as Biden was forced to eke out narrow wins in battlegrounds like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.

Party operatives fretted about Biden's light travel schedule during the campaign's final stretch. Some aides feared Biden's operation did not excite Black and Latino voters enough to get them to the polls.

Harris to Be Key Adviser

Biden's choice of Harris seemed designed to counter the criticism that he was a throwback candidate in a party pointed toward the future. A California senator and that state's former attorney general, Harris drew younger and minority voters to the campaign. Biden promised her that she would have the same access to the Oval Office that he did as vice president, and would be the last one to offer advice after a meeting.

Harris challenged Biden in the primaries after gaining national fame through her questioning of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh and Attorney General William Barr at their confirmation hearings. If Biden, who will turn 82 in 2024, decides not to seek a second term, she is almost certain to run again.

Ultimately, it was the coronavirus that sunk Trump's chance of a second term. Even after recovering from his bout with the virus, Trump attacked leading infectious disease experts, such as Anthony Fauci, a member of his own coronavirus task force. Polls routinely showed that voters rated Trump's pandemic response poorly.

While Trump held a series of rallies packed with unmasked supporters, Biden urged Americans to heed the warnings of scientists and medical experts to maintain social distancing and wear face coverings in public.

After canceling all in-person campaign events as the coronavirus swept across the U.S. in March, Biden later resumed travel after Labor Day and made a point of wearing a mask in public. His events were small and socially distant, and he held drive-in rallies of hundreds of people honking their support.

Biden made the race into a referendum on Trump, and the president tried to caricature Biden as a corrupt, past-his-prime politician who was too weak to hold off the far left wing of his party. The president coined a derisive nickname for Biden -- ""Sleepy Joe"" -- just like his ""Crooked Hillary"" moniker in 2016.

Trump was better able to define Clinton, whose campaign was overshadowed by controversy over her handling of her emails while secretary of State. A late October letter from then-FBI Director James Comey may have cemented Trump's win.

But attempts by Trump's associates to smear Biden as corrupt fell flat. A week before the election, 55% of voters surveyed in a CNN poll said they viewed the former vice president favorably.

Still, many of the same challenges that sunk Trump's presidency -- namely a resurgent pandemic that is slowing the U.S. economic recovery -- could overwhelm the rest of Biden's agenda.

He will be confronted with a cascading set of crises even beyond the pandemic: racial unrest, accelerating climate change and a possible Supreme Court ruling that could gut Obamacare, a policy he has promised to build on.",USA,https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-presidential-election-2020-joe-biden-wins-us-presidency-after-bitter-contest-with-trump-2322143
12/2/2020,UK approves Pfizer/BioNTech Covid vaccine for rollout next week,"The UK has become the first western country to license a vaccine against Covid, opening the way for mass immunisation with the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine to begin next week for those most at risk. The vaccine has been authorised for emergency use by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Authority (MHRA), before decisions by the US and Europe. The MHRA was given power to approve the vaccine by the government under special regulations before 1 January, when it will become fully responsible for medicines authorisation in the UK after Brexit. The first doses of the vaccine would arrive in the coming days, said the company. The UK has bought 40m doses of the vaccine, which has been shown to have 95% efficacy in its final trials. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said: “The government has today accepted the recommendation from the MHRA to approve Pfizer/BioNTech’s Covid-19 vaccine for use.

“This follows months of rigorous clinical trials and a thorough analysis of the data by experts at the MHRA who have concluded that the vaccine has met its strict standards of safety, quality and effectiveness.

“The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation will shortly also publish its latest advice for the priority groups to receive the vaccine, including care home residents, health and care staff, the elderly and the clinically extremely vulnerable. The vaccine will be made available across the UK from next week.”

The health secretary, Matt Hancock, said the first doses would be issued to the most vulnerable people. The UK would have 800,000 doses available next week, he said.

“This is fantastic news. The MHRA, the fiercely independent regulator, has clinically authorised the vaccine for rollout. The NHS stands ready to make that happen,” he told Sky News.

“From early next week we will start the programme of vaccinating people against Covid-19 here in this country. The MHRA have approved it as clinically safe and we have a vaccine, so it’s very good news.”

Hancock said rolling out the vaccine across the UK would be “challenging” because it needed to be kept at -70C. A network of 50 hospitals was ready to deliver the first jabs, he said, and specialist vaccination centres were being built.

He said the vaccine would also be available from some GPs and pharmacists if they had cold storage facilities.

Hancock told BBC News each person would need two jabs and the “bulk” of the 40m order was expected to be available in the new year.


Older people and those in care homes, including staff, would be first in line for immunisation “and then it essentially comes down the age range”, Hancock said. NHS staff were also high on that priority list and also the clinically extremely vulnerable, he said.

He added: “The goal will be to vaccinate through the NHS right across the UK as rapidly as the company can manufacture. It will help save lives. Once we’ve protected the most vulnerable it will help us all get back to normal and back to some of the things that we love.”

Hancock told BBC News that from Easter next year, the country could return to some normality and indicated that no restrictions would be needed by summer 2021.

He said: “So many families have suffered, including my own. I’m just so, so pleased … 2020 has been just awful and 2021 is going to be better. Help is on its way. Help is on its way with this vaccine – and we can now say that with certainty rather than with all the caveats that we normally have to put around that.

“I’m confident now, with the news today, that from spring – from Easter onwards – things are going to be better. We’re going to have a summer next year that everybody can enjoy. Between now and then we’ve got to hold our resolve.”

The JCVI is expected to set out later on Wednesday morning which groups of people will be eligible from next week.

Albert Bourla, the chairman and chief executive officer of Pfizer added: “Today’s emergency use authorisation in the UK marks a historic moment in the fight against Covid-19. This authorisation is a goal we have been working toward since we first declared that science will win, and we applaud the MHRA for their ability to conduct a careful assessment and take timely action to help protect the people of the UK.”

Although the vaccine has to be kept at -70C, the companies say it can be stored for up to five days in a fridge, at 2-8°C. The first priority groups for vaccination are care home residents, who may not be able to come to a vaccination centre, together with the staff who look after them. At fridge temperatures, it may be possible for the vaccine to be brought to them. Next in line will be the over-80s and NHS staff.


The trial data showed the vaccine had equal efficacy among younger volunteers and those over 65 who are most at risk from Covid. Gender, race and ethnicity also made no difference.

Pfizer and BioNTech say their combined manufacturing network has the potential to supply globally up to 50m vaccine doses in 2020 and up to 1.3bn doses by the end of 2021.

The delivery of the UK’s 40m doses will start immediately. Delivery will continue throughout 2020 and 2021 in stages “to ensure an equitable allocation of vaccines across the geographies with executed contracts”, say the companies.

The US, which has ordered 100m doses, and Europe, which has bought 200m, are expected to approve the vaccine within weeks.

The MHRA has moved with unprecedented speed to grant emergency use authorisation, having received the final data from the companies on 23 November. It has been carrying out a rolling approval process, scrutinising data from early trials as they came in.

“The emergency use authorisation in the UK will mark the first time citizens outside of the trials will have the opportunity to be immunised against Covid-19,” said U?ur ?ahin, the CEO and co-founder of BioNTech.

“We believe that the rollout of the vaccination programme in the UK will reduce the number of people in the high-risk population being hospitalised. Our aim is to bring a safe and effective vaccine upon approval to the people who need it. The data submitted to regulatory agencies around the world are the result of a scientifically rigorous and highly ethical research and development programme.”

12/24/2020,Which countries have rolled out COVID vaccine?,"The mass vaccination programme to protect people from the coronavirus has started globally to combat the pandemic, which has killed more than 1.73 million people globally and infected 78 million people since late December last year. On December 8 2020, the United Kingdom became the first country in the world to start administrating its citizens with a fully trialled and tested COVID-19 vaccine, soon followed by several other nations. Here is a list of countries that have approved and started administrating the COVID vaccines to their populations:

Argentina
Health workers will be first in line to receive the first shot of the two-component Russian Sputnik V vaccine on December 29

The vaccine will be administered across all 23 provinces and in the capital Buenos Aires.

Belarus
On December 29, Belarus started administering the Russian-made Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine to its populations, local media reported.

The country’s long-time leader Alexander Lukashenko said recently the goal was to voluntarily vaccinate up to 2 million people in the Eastern European nation that has close ties to Moscow.

Belgium
People in Belgium received the first COVID-19 vaccines developed by BioNTech/Pfizer on December 28.

The first vaccine was given to 96-year-old Jos Hermans at a nursing home in the municipality of Puurs, where Pfizer’s production facility is located.

“I feel 30 years younger now,” Hermans told local media after receiving the vaccine.The country of 11 million plans to vaccinate 70 percent of its population by the end of 2021.

Brazil
On January 23, Brazil began distributing two million ready-to-use AstraZeneca PLC COVID-19 vaccines after they arrived in the country from India. Brazil’s government had a deal with AstraZeneca to produce up to 100 million doses of its vaccine locally, but the delivery of the active ingredient needed to manufacture them was plagued by delays from China.

As a result, AstraZeneca agreed to supply the government with 2 million ready-to-use doses made in India.Canada
The first COVID-19 patient to be inoculated in Canada was an 89-year-old woman from Quebec who received the Pfizer vaccine on December 14.

The North American country, along with neighbouring US, has also approved the Moderna vaccine for its mass immunisation programme. The first shipment of the Moderna shots arrived on Thursday.

Chile
On December 24, Chile became the second Latin American nation after Mexico to start its inoculation programme.
Zulema Riquelme, a 42-year-old nurse, got the first jab in the presence of President Sebastian Pinera. Costa Rica
Costa Rica received its first shipment of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine doses on Wednesday, and the country administered the first shot on December 24 to a wheelchair-bound, 91-year-old nursing home resident, Elizabeth Castillo.

“I am very grateful to God, because I have asked so much of him. My life is very important to me, so take advantage of every moment,” Castillo said.

Costa Rican President Carlos Alvarado Quesada said the vaccinations “may be the beginning of the end of this pandemic”.

Croatia
An 81-year-old nursing home resident became the first person on December 27 to receive the COVID-19 vaccine in Croatia.

Top Croatian officials attended as Branka Anicic received the vaccine in front of cameras. Anicic said she was “so happy” to have been chosen, and urged others to get it too.

Cyprus
Cyprus began rolling out its vaccination programme on December 27, with pensioners at homes in the capital Nicosia and the towns of Larnaca and Limassol being the first to receive a shot of the two-dose vaccine.

The Czech Republic
Prime Minister Andrej Babis was the first to get the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine at the Central Military Hospital in Prague on December 27, just before other hospitals in the capital and second-largest city Brno started to distribute the 9,750 doses the country has received so far.

“The vaccine which arrived from the European Union yesterday, that is a hope, a hope that we will return to a normal life,” Babis said before taking the jab.
Finland
Six frontline health workers – three women and three men – were on December 27 the first to be vaccinated with the new coronavirus vaccine in Finland. The vaccinations took place at Helsinki University Hospital.

France
The first vaccines in France were applied to a woman and a doctor, both 78, in Rene-Muret Hospital near the capital Paris on December 26.

Germany
Vaccinations against the coronavirus began in the German state of Saxony-Anhalt on December 26.

At the Krueger centre for senior citizens in the town of Halberstadt, 101-year-old Edith Kwoizalla was the first of its residents to be vaccinated.

Greece
Efstathia Kambissiouli, head nurse at an intensive care unit, became the first person on December 27 to receive the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine.

Greece’s president and prime Minister were the third and fourth people in the country to get inoculated.

On January 16, India started one of the world’s largest vaccination campaigns, as part of efforts by the populous nation to bring the COVID-19 pandemic under control starting with two locally-manufactured shots.

The campaign prioritised nurses, doctors and other frontline workers.

“We are launching the world’s biggest vaccination drive and it shows the world our capability,” Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said. He implored citizens to keep their guard up and not to believe any “rumours about the safety of the vaccines”.",Global,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/12/24/vaccine-rollout-which-countries-have-started
8/11/2020,Beirut explosion: What we know so far,"The Lebanese government has resigned amid growing public anger following a devastating explosion in Beirut on 4 August that killed at least 200 people and injured around 5,000 others. Here is what we know so far.
What happened?
The disaster was preceded by a large fire at the Port of Beirut, on the city's northern Mediterranean coast. In videos posted on social media white smoke could be seen billowing from Warehouse 12, next to the port's huge grain silos.
Shortly after 18:00 (15:00 GMT), the roof of the warehouse caught alight and there was a large initial explosion, followed by a series of smaller blasts that some witnesses said sounded like fireworks going off.
About 30 seconds later, there was a colossal explosion that sent a mushroom cloud into the air and a supersonic blastwave radiating through the city.That blast wave levelled buildings near the port and caused extensive damage over much of the rest of the capital, which is home to two million people. Hospitals were quickly overwhelmed.
""What we are witnessing is a huge catastrophe,"" said the head of the Lebanese Red Cross, George Kettani. ""There are victims and casualties everywhere.""
Beirut Governor Marwan Abboud said as many as 300,000 people had been made temporarily homeless and that collective losses might reach $10-15bn (£8-11bn).How big was the blast?
The blast destroyed the immediate dockside area, creating a crater approximately 140m (460ft) wide, which flooded with seawater.
The warehouse where the initial fire and explosions were observed was obliterated and an adjacent grain silo was heavily damaged.
Satellite images show complete devastation in the port area, with one ship apparently blown out of the water and onto the dockside.The explosion's shockwave blew out windows at Beirut International Airport's passenger terminal, about 9km (5 miles) away from the port.
The blast was also heard as far away as Cyprus, about 200km across the Mediterranean Sea, and seismologists at the United States Geological Survey said it was the equivalent of a 3.3-magnitude earthquake.

Based on an analysis of videos, a team from the University of Sheffield estimated that the explosion was the equivalent of 1,000 to 1,500 tonnes of TNT - about a 10th of the intensity of the nuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima in 1945.
""Whatever the precise charge size, this is unquestionably one of the largest non-nuclear explosions in history, far bigger than any conventional weapon,"" said Professor Andy Tyas, an expert on blast protection engineering.

What was the cause?
Lebanon's Prime Minister, Hassan Diab, blamed the detonation on 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate that he said had been stored unsafely at a warehouse in the port.
A similar amount of the chemical arrived on a Moldovan-flagged cargo ship, the MV Rhosus, which docked in Beirut in 2013 after suffering technical problems while sailing from Georgia to Mozambique.
The Rhosus was inspected, banned from leaving and was shortly afterwards abandoned by its owners, according to Shiparrested.com. Its cargo was reportedly transferred to Warehouse 12 following a court order, and should have been disposed of or resold.

There is now a huge crater where the warehouse storing the ammonium nitrate once stood
Ammonium nitrate is a crystal-like white solid commonly used as a source of nitrogen for agricultural fertiliser. But it can also be combined with fuel oils to create an explosive used in the mining and construction industries. Militants have made bombs with it in the past.
Experts say that ammonium nitrate is relatively safe when stored properly. However, if you have a large amount of material lying around for a long time it begins to decay.
Who were the victims?
More than 200 people were killed, including at the port and further afield.
Among the dead who have been identified was Jean-Marc Bonfils, a Beirut-born French architect. Mr Bonfils, who was involved in restoring buildings damaged in the city during the civil war, was broadcasting video of the incident live on Facebook after the first explosion but was injured in the second and later died. French Culture Minister Roselyne Bachelot said that France and Lebanon were united in grief at his death.
Firefighter Sahar Fares was a first responder at the scene of the blast. Her fiance Gilbert Qaraan mourned her in a post on Instagram, saying his heart burned with the loss. A photo posted on social media showed Sahar and seven male colleagues, all of whom are said to have died.
They were not the only emergency workers to lose their lives during the explosion. According to a list of confirmed casualties released by the Ministry of Health, at least five nurses also died.
German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said a female diplomat from the German embassy had died in her apartment.
There are also reports of one American and two Egyptians killed in the blast, while a two-year-old boy from Australia has been confirmed dead.
The Lebanon-based cruise ship agency Abou Merhi said two people died and seven were injured when its Orient Queen ship was severely damaged by the blast.
The governor of Beirut has said that dozens of people were still missing, including many foreign workers.
Who is to blame?
President Aoun promised a transparent investigation into the blast and at least 20 people have been arrested so far.
Prime Minister Diab described the circumstances that led to the explosion as ""unacceptable"" but offered his government's resignation six days later. However, he avoided taking responsibility for the blast and instead blamed the country's entrenched political elite.
Mr Koraytem and the director general of Lebanese Customs, Badri Daher, said their warnings about the danger posed by the stored ammonium nitrate and calls for it to be removed were repeatedly ignored.
""We requested that it be re-exported but that did not happen. We leave it to the experts and those concerned to determine why,"" Mr Daher told broadcaster LBCI.

Lebanese President Michel Aoun vowed to hold those responsible to account
Documents circulated online appeared to show that customs officials sent letters to the judiciary seeking guidance at least six times from 2014 to 2017.
But investigative journalist Riyad Qobaissi says these letters did not follow the right procedures and that customs officials simply kept resending the same letters in response to the judge's request for more information.
The government has ordered officials at the port who oversaw the storage of the ammonium nitrate to be put under house arrest pending the completion of the investigation.
Lebanon's minister of public works, meanwhile, told Al Jazeera that he found out about the presence of ammonium nitrate in July and spoke to the port's general manager just two days before the explosion.
""No minister knows what's in the hangars or containers, and it's not my job to know,"" Michael Najjar, who has been in his post for six months, told the channel.
However, President Aoun has so far rejected the possibility of any international investigation and has suggested that ""external interference through a rocket or bomb or other act"" could also have led to the blast.
Many Lebanese were unimpressed by the government's promises of transparency and accountability, and there were clashes between protesters and police.
The anger and demonstrations have continued even after the government's resignation, with many people seeing last week's deadly explosion as the deadly result of years of entrenched corruption and mismanagement.",Beirut,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-53668493
