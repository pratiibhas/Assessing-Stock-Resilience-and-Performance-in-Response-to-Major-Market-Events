3/12/2023,Silicon Valley Bank is a major bank that has failed. But hereís why itís not the 2008 financial crisis again,"Silicon Valley Bank's downfall is the largest failure of a financial institution since Washington Mutual collapsed at the height of the financial crisis more than a decade ago. However, experts donít expect issues spreading to the broader banking sector.The financial institution best known for its relationships with high-flying world technology startups and venture capital, Silicon Valley Bank, experienced one of the oldest problems in banking ó a bank run ó which led to its failure Friday.
Its downfall is the largest failure of a financial institution since Washington Mutual collapsed at the height of the financial crisis more than a decade ago. And it had immediate effects. Some startups that had ties to the bank scrambled to pay their workers, and feared they might have to pause projects or lay off or furlough employees until they could access their funds.How did this happen? Hereís what to know about why the bank failed, who was affected most, and what to know about how it may, and may not affect, the wider banking system in the U.S.Why did Silicon Valley Bank fail?
Silicon Valley Bank was hit hard by the downturn in technology stocks over the past year as well as the Federal Reserveís aggressive plan to increase interest rates to combat inflation.The bank bought billions of dollars worth of bonds over the past couple of years, using customersí deposits as a typical bank would normally operate. These investments are typically safe, but the value of those investments fell because they paid lower interest rates than what a comparable bond would pay if issued in todayís higher interest rate environment.
Typically thatís not an issue, because banks hold onto those for a long time ó unless they have to sell them in an emergency.
But Silicon Valleyís customers were largely startups and other tech-centric companies that started becoming more needy for cash over the past year. Venture capital funding was drying up, companies were not able to get additional rounds of funding for unprofitable businesses, and therefore had to tap their existing funds ó often deposited with Silicon Valley Bank, which sat in the center of the tech startup universe.So Silicon Valley customers started withdrawing their deposits. Initially that wasnít a huge issue, but the withdrawals started requiring the bank to start selling its own assets to meet customer withdrawal requests. Because Silicon Valley customers were largely businesses and the wealthy, they likely were more fearful of a bank failure since their deposits were over $250,000, which is the government-imposed limit on deposit insurance.That required selling typically safe bonds at a loss, and those losses added up to the point that Silicon Valley Bank became effectively insolvent. The bank tried to raise additional capital through outside investors, but was unable to find them.
The fancy tech-focused bank was brought down by the oldest issue in banking: a good olí run on the bank. Bank regulators had no other choice but to seize Silicon Valley Bankís assets to protect the assets and deposits still remaining at the bank.
What happens next?
There are two large problems remaining with Silicon Valley Bank, but both could lead to further issues if not resolved quickly.
The most immediate problem is Silicon Valley Bankís large deposits. The Federal government insures deposits to $250,000, but anything above that level is considered uninsured. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation said insured deposits would be available on Monday morning. However the vast majority of Silicon Valley Bankís deposits were uninsured, a unique characteristic of the bank due to its customers being largely startups and wealthy tech workers.At the moment, all of that money canít be accessed and likely will have to be released in an orderly process. But many businesses cannot wait weeks to get access to funds to meet payroll and office expenses. It could lead to furloughs or layoffs Two, thereís no buyer of Silicon Valley Bank. Typically bank regulators look for a stronger bank to take on the assets of a failing bank, but in this case, another bank hasnít stepped forward. A bank buying Silicon Valley Bank could go a long way to resolving some of the problems tied with the money that startups canít get to right now.
Is this a sign that we could repeat what happened in 2008?
At the moment, no, and experts donít expect there to be any issues spreading to the broader banking sector.
Silicon Valley Bank was large but had a unique existence by servicing nearly exclusively the technology world and VC-backed companies. It did a lot of work with the particular part of the economy that was hit hard in the past year.
Other banks are far more diversified across multiple industries, customer bases and geographies. The most recent round of ìstress testsî by the Federal Reserve of the largest banks and financial institutions showed that all of them would survive a deep recession and a significant rise in unemployment.However, there might be economic ripple effects in the Bay Area and in the technology start-up world if the remaining money canít be released quickly.",Global,https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/silicon-valley-bank-failure-2008-financial-crisis-8492382/

7/20/2023,"Explained | What are the takeaways from the NATO summit?
","The story so far: For quite a few years, many questions were asked about the relevance of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). However, the war in Eastern Europe has upended these narratives and provided a renewed raison d‚Äôetre not just for strengthening the alliance but its expansion as well. The latest NATO summit held in Vilnius this month underscored both these strategic necessities for the NATO. A standout of the Vilnius Summit was the attendance of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and the anticipation around the possibility of extending NATO membership to Ukraine. In this regard, the launch of the NATO-Ukraine Council as a forum for crisis consultations and decision-making indicated that NATO tried to assuage the feelings of Ukraine for not being included in the alliance by creating a mechanism for its wider engagement, support and future inclusion as a full member. From Ukraineís perspective, the Vilnius summit did usher promise but little immediate gains. All three priorities outlined by President Zelenskyy ó new weapons packages, security guarantees and an invitation to join NATO ó went unfulfilled. However, the U.K. did pledge ammunition support to Ukraine. Additionally, garbed in the urgency to help Ukraine, NATO has levelled up its own defences. NATOís new plans involve maintaining a force of 300,000 troops, with air and naval capabilities, while emphasising the importance of a strong industrial base, leading to the endorsement of a Defence Production Action Plan.

7/11/2023,Nato summit: Ukraine's future membership to be discussed by leaders in Vilnius,"Nato leaders are gathering in Lithuania for a crucial summit that could shape the direction of the war in Ukraine and the future of the Western alliance.
The 31 allies hope to show Russia they have the resolve to support Ukraine militarily for the long term.
They arrive with a welcome boost after Turkey dropped its objections to Sweden joining the alliance.
But there remains disagreement over what to say about Ukraine's own ambitions of future membership.
It is thought some allies will promise Kyiv new security guarantees designed to deter future Russian aggression. They will also discuss providing more weapons and ammunition.
On the membership issue, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky wants Nato to say Ukraine could join as soon as possible after the fighting ends - setting out explicitly how and when this could be achieved.
But some Nato nations are reluctant to go too far, fearing the promise of near-automatic membership could give Russia an incentive both to escalate and drag out the war.
Jens Stoltenberg, the Nato secretary general, said no final decision had been made on the language of the final communiquÈ, but added: ""I am absolutely certain that we will have unity and a strong message on Ukraine.""
But after late night talks on Monday, he announced that Turkey had agreed to support Sweden's application to join Nato. The news was welcomed by the US and Germany, as well as Sweden itself.
Turkey had spent months blocking Stockholm's application, accusing it of hosting Kurdish militants. Mr Stoltenberg said the two sides had worked together to address Turkey's ""legitimate security concerns"".
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan earlier suggested he would back Sweden if the EU re-opened frozen membership talks with Ankara - a request that was rejected by EU officials.

Ukraine wants more than warm words over membership
What is Nato and what is its new Russia plan?
Over their two-day meeting, Nato leaders are expected to agree new plans to deter and defend the alliance against future Russian aggression by beefing up their forces in the east.
And they are also expected to step up their financial commitment, making the target of spending 2% of national wealth on defence a minimum figure, rather than a general ambition. Rishi Sunak's spokesman said the UK prime minister would call on allies directly to meet this target.
Security is tight in Vilnius, with Nato forces - including Patriot air defence missiles - defending a summit taking place only a short distance from Belarus and the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad.
The overarching aim of the meeting is for Nato to convince President Vladimir Putin of the alliance's long-term military commitment to Ukraine.
Officials hope this could begin to change the Russian leader's thinking, putting doubt in his mind that he can outwait the West.
As such, some see this summit as potentially as important as military gains on the battlefield in persuading Mr Putin to change his strategy.
So some Nato members will promise Ukraine new security guarantees. US President Joe Biden has suggested Ukraine could get the kind of military support his country gives Israel - long-term commitments designed to deter potential aggressors.
The alliance will also deepen its institutional links with Ukraine. An existing forum - the Ukraine Nato Commission - will be upgraded to a Ukraine Nato Council. This will give Ukraine the ability to summon meetings of the alliance as an equal partner round the table. ""The right to consult is not insignificant,"" said one official.
But perhaps most importantly, some members are expected to set out more explicitly Ukraine's pathway to joining the alliance.
Nato agreed at its 2008 summit in Bucharest that Ukraine ""will"" become a member and supported its application. But the alliance did not say how and when this might happen. Critics say giving Ukraine a destination but no itinerary allowed Mr Putin to risk his invasions in both 2014 and 2022.
Mr Biden will meet Mr Zelensky at the summit, a US official told Reuters, although the Ukrainian president is yet to officially confirm his participation at the event.

Leaders are expected to beef up their forces in Eastern Europe
Kyiv accepts Nato cannot formally invite Ukraine to join while fighting rages. That would risk plunging the alliance into war with Russia, as Nato would be obliged under Article 5 of its treaty to defend any member that is under attack.
Instead, Kyiv wants a clear promise of post-war membership with a timeline, so it knows victory will bring the security guarantee of Nato's nuclear umbrella.
One way for Nato to signal its desire to welcome Ukraine into its ranks would be to shorten the so-called membership application plan, known as the MAP. This is the formal process which tests whether a country meets Nato's strict military and governmental standards - and it can take decades.
But it is what Nato might actually say about Ukraine's potential membership that is dividing the alliance.
The Baltic states and eastern European nations are pushing for as much clarity as possible. They want the alliance to make clear how much progress Ukraine has made towards membership, especially how much more closely its army can operate with other Nato forces, now that it shares similar weapons and strategies. They also want Nato to make clear what further conditions Ukraine must meet to achieve membership.
Gitanas Nauseda, the president of Lithuania, said Nato should avoid Ukraine's membership becoming a horizon: ""The more you walk towards it, the farther it is.""
But some allies - including the US and Germany - are cautious about promising Ukraine too much. They want Ukraine to do more to tackle corruption, strengthen its judiciary and ensure civilian control over its military.
Some also worry about Nato getting dragged into open conflict with Russia. They fear promising Ukraine membership after the war would give Putin an incentive both to escalate the conflict and drag it out, maintaining low-intensity fighting to prevent Ukraine ever joining.
Other allies also fear losing room for manoeuvre in any post-war negotiations. They want to use the promise of Nato membership as a carrot for Ukraine and a stick for Russia, but only after the fighting has ended.",Global,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-66157625

8/22/2023,Brics group looks to expand at summit despite divisions among key members,"Leaders from developing countries representing almost half the worldís population including China and Russia are meeting in South Africa for a key summit aimed at reinforcing their alliance as a counterweight to the west.

The Brics grouping summit in Johannesburg is being hosted by the South African president, Cyril Ramaphosa, and brings together the prime minister of India, Narendra Modi, as well the presidents of China, Xi Jinping, and Brazil, Luiz In·cio Lula da Silva.

Dozens of leaders of other countries in Africa, Asia and the Middle East are also attending, many hoping to be invited to join the bloc. The two-day summit opens on Tuesday morning.

Russia is being represented by its foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, after Vladimir Putin decided not travel to Johannesburg to avoid forcing South Africa to choose between fulfilling conflicting obligations as hosts of the summit and as a member of the international criminal court.

The ICC has issued an arrest warrant for the Russian president for alleged war crimes in Ukraine that would have theoretically compelled South Africa to detain him. Putin will now only attend virtually.

The summit may see the Brics group, whose economies account for a quarter of global gross domestic product, take a clearly anti-western turn. This raises the prospect of a new and re-energised economic and political actor against the US and its allies in world affairs.

On Sunday, Ramaphosa sought to reassure concerned observers and domestic opponents that South Africa would ìnot be drawn into a contest between global powersî and wanted to avoid a world that was ìincreasingly polarised into competing campsî.

ìOur decision not to align with any one of the global powers does not mean that we are neutral on matters of principle or national interest,î he told viewers in a televised national address.

One issue at the summit will be moves to undermine the dominance of the US dollar in international trade transactions, which would be helpful to Russia as its economy struggles with sanctions imposed after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine last year.

China is looking to build a broader coalition of developing countries to extend Beijingís influence and reinforce its efforts to compete with the US on the global stage.

ìThe traditional global governing system has become dysfunctional, deficient and missing in action,î the Chinese ambassador to South Africa, Chen Xiaodong, said at a briefing in Pretoria last week, adding that the Brics grouping was ìincreasingly becoming a staunch force in defending international justiceî.

But both Chinaís expansion plans and the more explicitly political stance that Beijing has outlined has riled India, the most populous country in the group.

Prof Harsh Pant, an international relations expert at the Observer Research Foundation, a thinktank in Delhi, said: ìIndia is looking to ensure that this platform doesnít just drift off into [being] an openly anti-western platform, and there is a danger of that with both Russia and China having a certain agenda.

ìIndia and least of all Modi have no interest in shaping Indiaís foreign policy in an anti-western direction. Brics was conceived as a geoeconomic platform but is drifting into a geopolitical role and India is not likely to be comfortable with that.î

Officials in South Africa say more than 40 countries have expressed interest in joining Brics. Twenty three are thought to have asked formally to be admitted.

Anil Sooklal, South Africaís ambassador at large for Asia and the Brics, said one of the reasons countries were lining up to join the group was a ìvery polarised worldî that had been further polarised by the Ukraine war, and that countries were being forced to take sides.

ìCountries in the [global] south donít want to be told who to support, how to behave and how to conduct their sovereign affairs. They are strong enough now to assert their respective positions,î said Sooklal.

Among potential new members are Iran and Venezuela, both hit by sanctions and diplomatically isolated.

RamÛn Lobo, Venezuelaís former finance minister and central bank president, told Reuters: ìOther integration frameworks that exist globally have been blinded by the hegemonic vision put forward by the US government.î

Russia also sees the summit as an opportunity to reinforce its alliances in the developing world, particularly in Africa. Putin hosted African leaders in St Petersburg for a second Russia-Africa summit last month.

African candidates for membership such as Ethiopia and Nigeria are attracted by the blocís commitment to UN reforms that would give Africa a more powerful global voice. Others believe an expanded Brics may be able to drive through changes to the World Trade Organization, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.

With Indiaís opposition to any new members of Brics without very strict safeguards and its concerns that Beijing will pack the group with anti-western allies, there is very unlikely to be consensus, say experts, meaning immediate expansion is improbable.

ìI donít think weíll see any explicit messages on this issue, just some anodyne statement,î said Pant.

Many analysts are also sceptical of hopes that even an enlarged Brics grouping could have much impact. Since its foundation in 2009, the blocís ambitions to exert significant global political and economic influence has been undermined by the differences between the values, interests and political systems of its members.

Steven Gruzd of the South African Institute of International Affairs, a thinktank, said: ìThey may have too high expectations of what Brics membership will actually bring in practice.î",Global,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/21/brics-looks-to-expand-bloc-south-africa-summit-divisions-key-members-india
8/24/2023,ëA wall of BRICSí: The significance of adding six new members to the bloc,"Johannesburg, South Africa ñ The BRICS bloc of top emerging economies have taken a major step in expanding its reach and influence with the announcement that six more nations have been invited join as new members.

Argentina, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have been invited to join as full members from January 1 next year.The bloc, which was formed in 2009 with Brazil, Russia, India and China, first expanded to admit South Africa in 2010.

Now, it is says it is seeking to grow a stronger coalition of developing nations who can better put the interests of the Global South on the worldís agenda.

Before the start of its annual summit in South Africa this week, more than 40 countries had expressed interest in joining BRICS, and 23 formally applied to join.

ìWe appreciate the considerable interest shown by countries of the Global South in membership of BRICS,î the bloc said in the Johannesburg II declaration it adopted on the final day of the summit on Thursday.

It said the six were selected after ìBRICS countries reached consensus on the guiding principles, standards, criteria and procedures of the BRICS expansion processî ñ but did not provide more details about the specific criteria.

ëSignificant statesí
ìIt is hard to find commonalities among the six countries invited to join BRICS other than that they are each significant states in their region,î Danny Bradlow, a professor with the Centre for the Advancement of Scholarship at the University of Pretoria, told Al Jazeera.With the inclusion of Saudi Arabia, Iran, UAE and Egypt, ìyou could argue itís very Middle East centricî, according to Sanusha Naidu, a senior research fellow at the Institute for Global Dialogue, a South African think tank focusing on China and Africa.

ìThis has geo-economic, geostrategic and geopolitical implications,î Naidu argued, saying the latest additions will push some BRICS nations to think more about their Middle East policies, and for China and India to beef the existing policies.China recently brokered the re-establishment of ties between Saudi Arabia and Iran, a role that would traditionally have been filled by a country like the United States.

Indiaís recently signed an agreement with the UAE to trade in Indian rupees and Emirati dirhams instead of in the US dollar.

Crucially, Naidu argued, the expansion list is ìvery energy centricî, adding that following the announcement, some analysts at the venue even facetiously commented if they should ìcall it BRICS plus OPEC?î.When selecting new members, the bloc may have taken into consideration the pricing of energy products, and how their countries can reduce their liability and vulnerability in terms of the cost of oil, she said.

ìBesides Russia, all of [the core BRICS countries] are non-energy producing countries. They need to be able to make their economies function, but they donít want to get caught in the secondary collateral damage of sanctions,î she explained.

The use of ìunilateral sanctionsî against countries and the continued dominance of the US dollar in global trade is something BRICS has vocally challenged.

The expansion ìopens up new avenues for tradeî, said Karin Costa Vasquez, a non-resident senior fellow at the Center for China and Globalization in Beijing.

One of the aims behind the planned expansion is ìcreating opportunities for BRICS nations to trade more easily with one another using local currenciesî, Vasquez added

ìThis shift could increase the potential for using currencies other than the US dollar, particularly by creating a network of countries that enhances the utility of their respective currencies.î

Inclusion
Analysts have said that one of the countries that could benefit from a trading regime outside of dollar dominance is Iran.

ìIran will clearly benefit the most,î said Naíeem Jeenah, a senior researcher at the South African think tank, Mapungupwe Institute for Strategic Reflection.

He said its inclusion ìhighlights the fact that itís not as politically isolated as the US wants it to beî.Inclusion could also be an ìeconomic lifelineî due to increased bilateral trade.

ìMembers would start trading with each other in their own currencies. For Iran, this would be great,î he said.

Jeenah added that Argentina was a ìshoe-inî as its inclusion was championed by Brazil, China and India. Among the African states, he said analysts expected Algeria, which has oil reserves, or Nigeria, which is the continentís most populous country and leading economy, could have been included.

Cheta Nwanze, a partner at SBM Intelligence, a geopolitical advisory that focuses on West Africa, said of Nigeriaís exclusion, ìI think itís an indictment of our foreign policy, or the lack of it thereof. We used to be very pan-African in our foreign policy, that has changedî.

ìOne thing that is very clear is that most of the rest of Africa ñ with the exception of maybe Nigeria and Kenya ñ are moving away from the West and towards the East. We are sticking in the Western camp without saying it explicitly, but more importantly without getting any benefits from being in the Western camp,î he told Al Jazeera.

Jeenah said the inclusion of Ethiopia, a country with one of the fastest-growing economies, that also hosts the headquarters of the African Union, ìmakes sense in those termsî.

Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the UAE are similar to India and, to some degree, South Africa, in that ìthese are countries that have one foot in BRICS and another foot in the Westî, Jeenah said.

But Saudi Arabia, in particular, is ìpositioningî itself in a way that shows it is not just in the American camp.

ìThey have other options now and are going to leverage these options,î he said, such as the China-brokered agreement to restore ties with Iran.

ëYour problems are not our problemsí
Analysts have remained undecided on what an expanded BRICS says to the West and means for the current global order, however.

ìThe grouping now represents a larger share of the worldís population and economy. However, this only means that the group is potentially a powerful voice for reform of the arrangements for global governance and a powerful actor in these arrangements,î Bradlow said.

ìWhether it actually becomes such a voice will depend on whether the expanded group is more effective than the BRICS have been in forging agreements on how the arrangements for global governance should be reformed and how they can more effectively serve the interests of the whole Global South.î

Naidu noted that ìhaving Iran in the BRICS sends a massive powerful message to the G7, to the Global North, to Washingtonî.

ìIt says, ëYou can have a problem with them, weíll keep them here.í And it also says, ëYour problems are not our problems.íîShe remarked that South Africa, which has important ties with the US, may have to deal with the ìfalloutî and navigate some of these tensions. But she also wondered whether the country could use the fact that it is in the bloc to its advantage.

ìYes, they donít have the economic muscle to do what they want to do, but they have the strategic muscle to say ëI have the BRICS behind me now, I have a wall of BRICS.íî

Jeenah said, ìWe must be careful about attributing more importance to this expansion development than it actually has Ö it certainly does not make BRICS into a Global South front. Itís just a club of 11 members.î

However, he added that, as yet, BRICS has not been trying act as a political forum, but that could change.

ìMore scary [for the West] than the six who were chosen is that 40 expressed interest in joining,î he said. ìBRICS is engaging in incremental expansion Ö So where does it go in 30 years time?

ìWhile hype of de-dollarisation isnít on the horizon, the fact is that in a few years time, two of three largest economies in the world could be trading with each other within the [BRICS] bloc without the US dollar, that would be cause for some concern.î",Global,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/8/24/analysis-wall-of-brics-the-significance-of-adding-six-new-members
12/13/2023,What is COP28 in Dubai and why is it important?,"World leaders have reached a new agreement to tackle climate change at a big UN meeting in Dubai.
The summit followed a year of extreme weather events in which many climate records were broken.
What was COP28 and where was it?
COP28 was the 28th annual United Nations (UN) climate meeting, where governments discuss how to limit and prepare for future climate change.
The summit took place in Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). It was scheduled to last from 30 November to 12 December 2023, but overran by a day.What does COP stand for?
COP stands for ""Conference of the Parties"", where the ""parties"" are the countries that signed up to the original UN climate agreement in 1992.
Why was holding COP28 in Dubai controversial?
The UAE is one of the world's top 10 oil-producing nations.
It appointed Sultan al-Jaber, chief executive of the state-owned oil company, as COP28 president.Oil - like gas and coal - is a fossil fuel. These are the main causes of climate change because they release planet-warming greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide when burned for energy.Mr Jaber's oil company is expected to rapidly expand production this decade.
Documents leaked to the BBC also suggested the UAE planned to use its role as COP28 host to strike new oil and gas deals.
Mr Jaber previously argued that he was uniquely well-placed to push for action from the oil and gas industry.
He said that as chairman of renewable energy firm Masdar, he had overseen the expansion of clean technologies like wind and solar power.
What was agreed at COP28 about fossil fuels?
For the first time, countries agreed on the need to ""transition away from fossil fuels in energy systems"".The text calls for this to be done ""in a just, orderly and equitable manner"". This is seen as an important recognition that richer countries are expected to move away from coal, oil and gas more quickly.
However, the deal doesn't compel countries to take action, and no timescale is specified.

The COP28 deal was the first to note the need to move away from the fossil fuels that drive global warming
Many groups - including the US, UK, EU and some of the nations which are most vulnerable to climate change - had wanted a more ambitious commitment to ""phase out"" fossil fuels.
The agreement includes global targets to triple the capacity of renewable energy like wind and solar power, and to double the rate of energy efficiency improvements, both by 2030.
It also calls on countries to accelerate low- and zero-emission technologies like carbon capture and storage.
Examining the impact of COP28's big step forward
How is my country doing tackling climate change?
Is the UK on track to meet its climate targets?
Why was COP28 so important?
COP28 came at a crucial time for the key target to limit long-term global temperature rises to 1.5C.
This was agreed by nearly 200 countries at COP21, which was held in Paris in 2015.
The Paris commitment is crucial to avoid the most damaging impacts of climate change, according to the UN's climate body, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).
However, before the final deal was agreed at COP28, there were warnings that the world is actually on track for around 2.7C of warming by 2100.
Recent progress had not been in line with what was required, the UN said, leaving a ""rapidly narrowing"" window for action to keep the 1.5C limit in reach.

What you can do to reduce carbon emissions
Who went to COP28?
Around 200 nations were represented in the talks.
UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, French President Emmanuel Macron, and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi were among the world leaders to attend the beginning of the summit.
US President Joe Biden and China's Xi Jinping did not go, but both countries were heavily represented.

King Charles gave the opening address, warning that humans were carrying out a ""vast, frightening experiment"" on the planet.
Nearly 100,000 politicians, diplomats, journalists and campaigners registered for the meeting, making it the biggest climate conference ever held.
This included around 2,400 people connected to the coal, oil and gas industries, which underlined concern about the influence of fossil fuel groups.
Will richer countries pay for climate change?
As COP28 got under way, it was announced that the ""loss and damage"" fund could start handing out money.
The fund was agreed at COP27. The idea is that richer countries - historically the main contributors to warming - pay poorer countries already facing the effects of climate change.

South Sudan is one many developing countries ravaged by the effects of climate change
But the details had remained deeply contested, with wealthy countries like the US reluctant to accept liability for past emissions.
A relatively small amount of money has been pledged so far, but getting the fund up and running is seen as a crucial step in building trust between richer and poorer countries.Separately, in 2009, developed countries pledged to give $100bn (£80bn) a year to developing countries by 2020, to help them reduce emissions and prepare for climate change.
The target was missed in 2020, but is ""likely"" to have been met in 2022, according to preliminary data.
The COP28 agreement highlights ""the growing gap"" between the needs of developing countries and the money provided to cut emissions - but there is no requirement for developed countries to provide more support.
Will COP28 make any difference?
Critics of previous COPs, including campaigner Greta Thunberg, accuse the summits of ""greenwashing"" - that is, letting countries and businesses promote their climate credentials without actually making the changes needed.
But the summits do offer the potential for global agreements that go beyond national measures.
For example, the 1.5C warming limit, agreed at COP21, has driven ""near-universal climate action"", according to the UN.
This has helped bring down the level of warming the world can expect - even though the world is still not acting at anywhere near the pace needed to achieve the Paris goals.
Ultimately, the success of COP28 will be determined by the changes the world puts into practice in the years ahead.",Global,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-67143989
12/7/2023,Cop28: highlights and lowlights so far,"A few days into the conference, in a story that made headlines around the world, the Guardian's Damian Carrington and the Centre for Climate Reporting revealed that Sultan Al Jaber had said in a video call last month that there was ‚Äúno science‚Äù indicating that a phase-out of fossil fuels was needed to restrict global heating to 1.5C (2.7F).
Outcry from climate scientists followed and Al Jaber, who runs the UAE‚Äôs state-owned oil company, Adnoc, the following day in which he was forced to defend his views. He claimed his remarks were misrepresented and that he believed a phase-down and phase-out of fossil fuels was ‚Äúinevitable and in fact essential‚Äù.
Concerns this Cop is too dominated by the fossil fuel industry, however, were heightened again on Tuesday when an analysis showed a record number of fossil fuel lobbyists had access. This amounted to more than 2,400 people ‚Äì or four times more than were registered the previous year.
Such an agreement would amount to a historic commitment, but every word of how this would be phrased is being haggled over, including whether this is a reduction or elimination of ‚Äúunabated‚Äù fossil fuels ‚Äì and what exactly that means. How this plays out will go a long way to deciding if this conference is a success.

12/10/2023,"COP28: The UNís net-zero food plan to save the 1.5-degree goal, combat climate ëdoomismí","The UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has identified 10 priority areas ñ such as livestock, soil and water, crops, diets and fisheries ñ where following the roadmap can help push the world closer to achieving ëZero Hungerí, the second of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 

The aim: to transform agrifood systems ñ which encompass how the food we eat is farmed or raised, how it is transported, and how and where we dispose of it ñ growing harvesting from net emitters to into a carbon sink by 2050, capturing 1.5 gigatons of greenhouse gas emissions annually.

The goal: To help to eliminate world hunger without driving the planet past the 1.5 degree limit for global warming as set by the Paris Agreement. 

On the side lines of the UN climate conference in Dubai (COP28), UN News spoke to David Laborde, Director of the Agrifood Economics Division at FAO, who said that the roadmap is designed to avoid ìdoomismî and provides avenues to act today in a way that can benefit all now and in the future. 

ìWe need policymakers to act. We need the civil society to be mobilized and the private sector to understand that making better choices today means making investments more sustainable and more profitable for tomorrow.î

While 120 action points may seem like a great deal, Mr. Laborde stressed that the end goal is to achieve ìa system transformation where everyone has to play a roleî.

ëA good starting pointí

Meanwhile, FAOís chief economist, Maximo Torero, told UN News that the goal of this roadmap is to transform agrifood systems through accelerated climate actions to ìhelp achieve food security and nutrition for all, today and tomorrow.î

With around 738 million chronically malnourished people around the world, Mr. Torero said food must be part of the discussion on climate and must attract climate investments, which currently sit at a meagre four percent.

According to a report released in connection to the roadmap, FAO said climate finance flowing to agrifood systems is strikingly low and continues to diminish compared to global climate finance flows, at a time when this type of financing is urgently needed.


He said the work being done at COP28 is ìa good starting pointî, and this roadmap can provide guidance for implementing the Emirates Declaration on Sustainable Agriculture, Resilient Food Systems, and Climate Action, which was launched at the high-level opening of the conference. 

Accelerating implementation

The FAO initiative was launched on the day dedicated to food, agriculture and water at Dubaiís Expo City, where ministers and other senior officials gathered to discuss pathways towards implementing the Emirates Declaration, now signed by over 150 member States. 

In a message to the high-level event, UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed said the Declaration is a ìpowerful statement of political will to drive the transitions we needî as the deadline to achieve the 2030 Agenda fast approaches. 

ìWith seven years remaining to achieve our sustainable development and climate goals, we need to urgently strengthen our collective efforts using food systems as a lever to accelerate implementation.î

Ms. Mohammed added that any path to fully realizing the long-term goals of the Paris Agreement must include agriculture and food systems, from which over one third of emissions emanate.  

A ëseaweed revolutioní

One innovative solution to some of the most pressing global challenges humanity is facing today can be found in seaweed, ìthe greatest untapped resource we have on the planetî.

Thatís according to Vincent Doumeizel, Senior Advisor on Oceans to the UN Global Compact, who told the UN News team at COP28 that he was leading the ìseaweed revolutionî which could help tackle not only the climate crisis, but also the food security and social crises. 

Mr. Doumeizel highlighted the enormous ability of seaweed to absorb carbon and be a sustainable substitute for plastics, making it a great tool for climate mitigations and biodiversity restoration. 

ìSeaweed can grow very fast ñ up to 40 centimetres a day to reach 60 meters high. So, they are a real forest, and they absorb more carbon than the Amazon Forest.î

Vincent Doumeizel, Senior Advisor on Oceans to the UN Global Compact, speaking to UN News at COP28 in Dubai.
UN News / Ezzat El-Ferri
The Oceans expert said outdated food systems are among the biggest contributors to climate change, biodiversity loss, water scarcity, soil depletion and social injustice, ìwith a massive number of modern slave active in these food systemsî.

He said seaweed farming in East Africa has already proven its ability to create jobs and empower women in East Africa where ì80 percent of the revenues go to womenî. 

Mr. Doumeizel noted that despite being nutrient and protein-packed, almost all the very little seaweed we eat today is gathered on the beaches.

He stressed the need to ìchange the narrativeî of fear and doom being presented to the future generations and to ìfeed them hope and optimismî. 

ìI believe that if we learn to cultivate the ocean, we will be remembered as the first generation on the planet that will be able to feed the entire population while mitigating climate change, while restoring biodiversity and alleviating poverty. We can be remembered as such, but it needs to be altogetherî.

7/24/2023,"Drive to eliminate global hunger by 2030 has stalled, UN warns","A goal to eliminate global hunger by 2030 looks increasingly impossible to achieve as the number of people suffering chronic hunger has barely changed over the past year, a UN report says.The annual State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World report, published on Wednesday, said about 733 million people faced hunger in 2023 ñ one in 11 people globally and one in five in Africa ñ as conflict, climate change and economic crises take their toll.
Global hunger remains high with more than 733 million facing hunger
It is estimated that between 713 and 757 million people, corresponding to 8.9 and 9.4 percent of the global population, respectively, may have faced hunger in 2023. Considering the mid-range (733 million), this is about 152 million more people than in 2019.
David Laborde, director of the division within the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) that helps prepare the survey, said that although progress had been made in some regions, the situation had deteriorated on a global level. The report also noted that 71.5 percent of people in low-income countries were not able to afford a healthy diet last year, compared with 6.3 percent in high-income countries.

While famines are easy to spot, poor nutrition is more insidious but can nonetheless scar people for life, stunting both the physical and mental development of babies and children and leaving adults more vulnerable to infections and illnesses.

ìWe are in a worse situation today than nine years ago when we launched this goal to eradicate hunger by 2030,î he told the news agency Reuters, saying challenges such as climate change and regional wars had grown more severe than envisaged a decade ago.

If current trends continue, about 582 million people will be chronically undernourished by the end of the decade, the report said.

Regional trends varied significantly with hunger continuing to rise in Africa, where growing populations, wars and climate upheaval weighed heavily. By contrast, Asia has seen little change, and Latin America has improved. ìMalnutrition affects a childís survival, physical growth, and brain development,î UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell said in a statement.

But she noted how global child stunting rates have dropped by one-third, or 55 million, in the past two decades and said this showed investments in child nutrition can tackle the current challenges.

ìWe must urgently step up financing to end child malnutrition. The world can and must do it. It is not only a moral imperative but also a sound investment in the future,î Russell said.

The UN also said the way the antihunger drive was financed had to change because greater flexibility is needed to ensure the countries most in need get help.

ìWe need to change how we do things to be better coordinated, to accept that not everyone should try to do everything but really be much more focused on what we are doing and where,î Laborde said.

Laborde noted that international aid linked to food security and nutrition amounted to $76bn a year, or 0.07 percent of the worldís total annual economic output.

ìI think we can do better to deliver this promise about living on a planet where no one is hungry,î he said.",Global,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/24/drive-to-eliminate-global-hunger-by-2030-has-stalled-un-warns

12/25/2023,Opinion: The Year India Engaged The World On Its Own Terms,"As we bid adieu to the year 2023, we are witnessing a global order that has been fundamentally reconfigured - politically, economically and diplomatically. Trends that were simmering below the surface for the last few years have burst into the open, revealing in the all their complexities the challenges that are becoming difficult to manage by extant frameworks and institutions. There is an intellectual void at the very heart of international relations and it is being filled by the overuse of the term ""disruption."" Whatever the world can't seem to grapple with or come to terms with is being labelled ""disruptive."" Indeed, this is an inflection point but the underlying forces shaping it had been there with us for some time now. 
The world is grappling with the fundamental transformations brought in by shifting power balance, technological overreach, and institutional decay. These underlying shifts have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and wars in Eurasia and the Middle East, resulting in global inflationary pressures, food and energy crises, and widespread economic downturn. Nations are frantically scraping their coffers to provide for their citizens' basic needs, and we are standing farther from achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
The post-COVID international landscape has been marred by increasing geo-political and geo-economic tensions. In the Indo-Pacific, the central theatre of global competition, several of these have culminated to present India with a series of challenging questions. These include navigating great power rivalry, conflicts, economic crises, deglobalisation, and adverse climate events, all against the backdrop of a weakening multilateral order.  
However, each of these challenges is equally offset by opportunities for India. Most notably these include the chance to regain trust and leverage in its neighbourhood, gain from the relocation of global supply chains, expand cooperation with the west, push its agenda for clean energy transition and solidify its credentials as a global leader while steering international discourse and cooperation. Successful navigation of these challenges and opportunities by India in the Indo-Pacific has the potential to elevate its status in the global order and ultimately provide it with crucial strategic gains.
This year saw India taking on the global leadership role with aplomb as its G-20 presidency gave New Delhi a chance to shape the agenda for global cooperation in a world emergingfrom the shadows of the COVID-19 pandemic. For India, this was an opportunity to underline its emerging status as a ""leading power."" The G-20 is unique in so far as it brings together the developed and the developing nations to discuss and create solutions to global governance challenges. New Delhi used this platform vociferous in giving voice to the aspirations of the Global South, at a time when few global powers have neither the time nor resources to cater to the most vulnerable-occupied as they are with their own domestic woes. The pressures of global disruption are being absorbed most by the poorer economies and few powers are willing to consider their challenges with the seriousness they deserve. By hosting one of the highest-profile international gatherings ever at a time of great turbulence and managing to forge consensus among key global stakeholders despite fragmentation, New Delhi signalled its readiness to think big and deliver big-something that much of the world had long expected from India.
This is in sync with India's desire to play a larger global role by not only participating in key global alliances and multilateral for a but also creating new ones, thereby demonstrating its commitment to collaborative and inclusive global governance in areas as diverse as climate change, sustainable development, global health, and peacekeeping. As a responsible global stakeholder, India's role as the ""first responder"" during natural disasters or conflicts has been key in enhancing its global profile. From being a persistent naysayer to a nation willing to share responsibility for global governance has been one of the most striking trends in Indian foreign policy. 
The second trend visible this year was India's continuing ability to balance its key partnerships. New Delhi's ties with major global powers continued to grow despite challenges. The Ukraine war did not create a rupture in India's ties with the West, something that was anticipated when the conflict had begun last year. Instead, these relations continued to grow and evolve. Despite the US accusations pertaining to the planned assassination of a Sikh separatist leader and US citizen Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, Indo-US ties have retained their momentum with cooperation on critical and emerging technologies emerging as a key driver. The dramatic resurgence of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue - the Quad - is the strongest manifestation of this new reality where the US and India are willing to forge a new partnership based on emerging realities. At the same time, India has been able to maintain its close defence and strategic ties with Russia.
The final aspect of India's external engagement this year has been a growing realisation that there is no substitute to building domestic capacities in critical sectors. Only a strong and self reliant India can take on an increasingly belligerent China and sustain it through regular systemic disruptions. If COVID-19 alerted India to the need for self reliance in critical infrastructure, the Russia-Ukraine war made it aware of the challenges that lie ahead with an acute dependence on other actors for defence supplies. In 2023, India clocked its highest defence export value of Rs.15,920 crores or roughly $5 billion-10 times more than the Rs.1,521 crores it garnered in 2016-17 for defence exports. This is a pivotal moment for the country's burgeoning military-industrial complex, while also significant for the government's larger 'Atmanirbhar' Initiative, where the defence industry is arguably leading the transition. In the economic realm, this has translated into a greater openness to forge substantive trade partnerships with like-minded nations. 
This is an inflection point for the global order and for India. India is on the cusp of achieving something dramatic: not only a top-tier economic power that is also a multicultural democracy but also a top-tier geopolitical player that can lead, not simply balance. The choices that New Delhi will make over the next few years will define the contours of that rise.

9/9/2023,Rice Prices Hit 15-Year High Globally After India Curbs: UN Food Body,"India announced in July a ban on exports of non-basmati white rice (Representational)
Paris, France:
Global rice prices reached a 15-year high in August after top exporter India banned some overseas sales of the grain, the Food and Agriculture Organization said Friday.
While global food prices eased in August, those of rice rose 9.8 percent compared to the previous month, ""reflecting trade disruptions in the aftermath of a ban on Indica white rice exports by India"", the FAO said in a monthly report.
""Uncertainty about the ban's duration and concerns over export restrictions caused supply-chain actors to hold on to stocks, re-negotiate contracts or stop making price offers, thereby limiting most trade to small volumes and previously concluded sales,"" the UN agency said.
Rice is a major world food staple and prices on international markets have soared in the wake of the Covid pandemic, the war in Ukraine and the impact of the El Nino weather phenomenon on production levels.
India announced in July a ban on exports of non-basmati white rice, which account for around a quarter of its total.
The consumer affairs and food ministry said at the time that the move would ""ensure adequate availability"" and ""allay the rise in prices in the domestic market"".
India accounts for more than 40 percent of all global rice shipments.
The ban was expected to hit African nations, Turkey, Syria and Pakistan, all of which were already struggling with high inflation, data analytics firm Gro Intelligence warned in a note in July.
The Philippines, one of the world's top importers of rice, reached a five-year agreement with Vietnam on Thursday to buy rice.
El Nino effect
World rice stocks are forecast to reach an all-time high of 198.1 million tonnes, with India and China holding nearly three quarter of this volume like in previous seasons, according to the FAO.
This total represents around 38 percent of rice consumption forecast over the same period.
But aggregate rice reserves held by the rest of the world are expected to end the year with a second successive contraction, it added.
El Nino could also have a negative effect on the next harvests.
The turmoil in the rice market comes as global food prices have been progressively easing from a peak last year after war broke out between major grain producers Russia and Ukraine.
The FAO's global food price index, which tracks monthly changes in international prices of a basket of food commodities, averaged 121.4 points in August, down 2.1 percent from July.
The index was 24 percent below the summit it reached in March 2022.
Prices of cereal, meat, dairy and vegetable oils all fell in August.
Sugar prices, however, rose by 1.3 percent due to ""heightened concerns over the impact of the El Nino phenomenon on sugarcane crops, along with below-average rains in August and persistent dry weather conditions in Thailand"".
'Modest' recovery
Global food prices had slightly rebounded in July when Russia pulled out of a deal brokered by the UN and Turkey that had enabled Ukraine to ship grains via the Black Sea.
The FAO said on Friday it had lowered its forecast for world trade in cereals in 2023 and 2024 to 466 million tonnes -- a 1.7 percent drop from the previous marketing season.
""Traded volumes of wheat and maize are all predicted to decline, due to a mix of reasons, including falling exports by Ukraine due to trade disruptions associated with the ongoing war,"" it said.
""FAO has also lowered its forecast for world trade in rice from the July figure considering the stepped-up export restrictions by India,"" the FAO added.
An expected recovery of the rice trade in 2024 would be ""modest"" if the India restrictions are protracted and El Nino disrupts production in other Asian exporters, the FAO added.

10/11/2023,High stakes: On the Assembly elections in five States in November 2023,"There is a tendency to equate elections to the five States of Chhattisgarh, Mizoram, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Telangana, scheduled for next month, as a'semi-final' before the Lok Sabha polls, but it is wrong to do so as most have populations that rival that of major countries and have specific electoral concerns. What distinguishes this particular cycle of elections is the largely bipolar nature of the contest between the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Indian National Congress in three of them, with regional parties being significant only in Mizoram and Telangana. In all three north-central Indian States with a large Hindi-speaking population, the BJP has sought to cash in on the popularity of the Union government and increased support for its unabashed Hindutva ideology. The Congress seeks to upend this by promising a caste census and focusing on its record of implementing welfare measures, or through a list of committed guarantees. In Rajasthan, Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot remains popular on account of his government's welfare measures, but his MLAs do not enjoy the same confidence, complicating his party's task to retain power, even if the scourge of factionalism seems to have been muted for now. In Madhya Pradesh, Chief Minister Shivraj Chouhan has spent 18 years at the helm and faces anti-incumbency over issues related to government performance on the economy and social discrimination, but the fertile ground for Hindutva ideology in the State has provided the BJP a cache of committed voters that has kept it in the fray.",India,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/high-stakes-the-hindu-editorial-on-the-assembly-elections-in-five-states-in-november-2023/article67404748.ece

6/12/2023,"GDP growth for FY 2023 was 7.2%, surpassing expectations, says CEA","The Chief Economic Advisor to the Government of India, Dr V Anantha Nageswaran, on Monday said the real GDP growth for the year ending March 2023 was 7.2 per cent, which surpassed expectations, as the underlying momentum in the economy was quite strong.During an interaction with the Industry, organised by the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India (ASSOCHAM) here, Nageswaran explained the current state of the Indian economy and said the government was optimistic about its medium-term performance.
Addressing the gathering, he said while goods exports were on the weaker side in 2022-23 due to the war in Ukraine and oil price rise, services exports did very well for the country. ""We have a good story to share about the Indian economy. The real GDP growth for the year ending March 2023 was 7.2 per cent, surpassing expectations. The underlying momentum in the economy is quite strong. We expect the final number to be even higher than 7.2 per cent,"" Nageswaran said.
He pointed out that the data shows that India's 4th quarter GDP of 6.1 per cent was actually much better than several other countries at this point.
Talking about the wholesale price index's deduction, he said it was not a drawback nor a drag on growth but ""it is actually going to lower input cost for our businesses as well"".""The Wholesale price index is coming down because of the slowdown in oil prices and the slowdown in food prices and in fact it is now negative. So people think when the wholesale prices come down, it may lead to a slowdown in GDP growth. Yes. We are expecting 6.5 per cent GDP growth which is lower than last year's 7.2 per cent. But that is the trend growth that India will continue to achieve. In fact this number can be higher if the export sector also performs, but that is going to be a challenge,"" he said.
The CEA acknowledged that merchandise export growth was something which needed continued efforts to maintain in order to keep our market share or gain the market share.""That's where the industry has to invest in R&D, has to do better marketing etc and diversify our product range and focus on quality. It's going to be a hard grind for the rest of the decade because global growth is not going to be very strong in the rest of the decade but services sector growth is surprisingly doing well for us because many companies now rely on India not only for IT enabled services,"" but others as well, he said.
Global companies rely on India even for accounting, risk management compliance, back office work and their dependence on India through global capability centres (GCC) have become much wider, he added.He claimed that macroeconomic management in India has been prudent during pandemic when compared to other advanced nations.
""The overall macroeconomic management in India has been prudent and sensible, avoiding overstretching ourselves during the pandemic. This has contributed to our stable growth and inflation management,"" he said.
Nageswaran said while the country has made significant strides, ""we must remain vigilant and continue our efforts"" towards growth and development.
""While progress has been made, there is still work to be done,"" he said.
He pointed out that there are nearly one lakh recognised Startups in India out of which over 43,000 are led by women.",India,https://www.business-standard.com/economy/news/gdp-growth-for-fy-2023-was-7-2-surpassing-expectations-says-cea-123061201208_1.html
