12/20/2024,Gaganyaan-G1 mission to validate critical technologies in the run-up to manned flight: VSSC Director S. Unnikrishnan Nair,"Gaganyaan-G1, the first of three un-crewed test missions that will lead up to Indiaâ€™s maiden human spaceflight, is designed to mimic - end to end - the actual flight and validate critical technologies and capabilities including the Human-rated Launch Vehicle Mark-3 (HLVM3), S. Unnikrishnan Nair, Director, Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC), has said. 
The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) began the ‘stacking,’ or assembly, of HLVM3 at the Satish Dhawan Space Centre, Sriharikota, on December 18, coinciding with the tenth anniversary of the sub-orbital Crew Module Atmospheric Re-entry Experiment (CARE) mission of 2014.

6/29/2020,"On India's First Human Mission's Launch Date, ISRO Chief Says...","Only one astronaut will fly to space in the Gaganyaan mission, Dr S Somanath said
New Delhi:
The Gaganyaan Mission is at a critical stage this year with three important missions scheduled for this year, ISRO Chairman Dr S Somanath told NDTV.
""We are at a critical juncture with Gaganyaan this year. We have three important missions scheduled. First and foremost is the unmanned mission to orbit, spend time in orbit and return; the second is a test about equipment and algorithm; the third is a test to check the launch pad scenario,"" he said.
The space agency also has a manned mission in the pipeline for which four astronaut-designates have been named. Of them, only one would ultimately fly to space, Dr Somanath said, adding that the others will also be trained.
Speaking about a launch date, Dr Somanath said, ""The first test flight of the Gaganyaan is scheduled for the end of next year if all goes well. But everything depends on the progress we are going to make.""
The first Gaganyaan crewed flight may last one day in space with the astronaut doing 16 orbits of Earth, this would effectively test the environmental life support and control systems says Dr Somanath.

Prashanth Nair, Angad Prathap, Ajit Krishnan, and Shubhanshu Shukla are the four test pilots of the Indian Air Force who have been chosen for the Gaganyaan mission. The human space flight mission aims to launch a crew of up to three members into a Low Earth Orbit and bring them back after a missing lasting up to a week.

Commuters amid dense fog during a cold winter day in Patna, Bihar,India, Friday,12, 2024. (Several trains were delayed at Delhi's Hazrat Nizamuddin Railway Station due to dense fog amid the severe coldwave conditions.To combat the bone-chilling temperatures, streets and public spaces became dotted with small groups huddled together around bonfires to keep warm.
Drone visuals from Munirka and Vasant Vihar areas showed fog enveloping the city, reducing visibility and traffic slowing down to a crawl on major roads and highways.
The impact of the coldwave extended beyond Delhi, as neighbouring states experienced similar weather woes. In Uttar Pradesh, Ayodhya was blanketed in dense fog, causing disruptions to daily life. Similarly, in West Bengal's Siliguri, a thick fog cover added to the woes of residents.
According to the India Meteorological Department, Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, and Uttar Pradesh are experiencing dense to very dense fog at many places, severely affecting visibility and disrupting transportation. Jammu & Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, and Rajasthan are grappling with isolated instances of dense fog, creating challenging conditions for residents.
The IMD predicts that dense to very dense fog conditions are likely to persist over North India for the next five days. The meteorological department anticipates cold day to severe cold day wave conditions over the plains of Northwest India for the next three days, with a gradual reduction thereafter.
Dense fog is forecasted in isolated pockets of Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Sub-Himalayan West Bengal & Sikkim, north Madhya Pradesh, Jammu division, West Rajasthan, Bihar, Odisha, East Rajasthan, Assam & Meghalaya, Mizoram & Tripura during specific periods in the coming days.
In addition to the foggy conditions, the IMD predicts that Cold Day to Severe Cold Day conditions will persist in many parts of Punjab and Haryana-Chandigarh on January 13, with cold day conditions likely in isolated pockets for the subsequent three days. Isolated pockets of Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh are also expected to experience Cold Day conditions today.

On Friday, the national capital woke up to bone-chilling temperatures as the mercury plummeted to 3.9 degrees Celsius, marking the lowest temperature recorded this season, according to officials from the IMD.
The maximum temperature for the day settled at 19.3 degrees Celsius, slightly below the season's average, further intensifying the coldwave that has engulfed the region. The IMD data revealed that Friday's minimum temperature was the lowest for this date since 2018. On January 12, 2017, the city recorded a low of 3 degrees Celsius.

2/13/2024,India farmers march: What are their demands? Why is govâ€™t blocking roads?,"Thousands of farmers on tractors and trucks are marching towards the Indian capital, New Delhi, to push the government to address their demands, including guaranteed prices for their produce and debt waivers.Police in Haryana state, which borders Delhi, on Tuesday fired tear gas on farmers to prevent them from reaching the capital, which has been converted into a fortress, reviving memories of the 16-month-long agitation by the farmers two years ago. Multiple entry points to the capital have been sealed by erecting barriers of barbed wire, spikes and cement blocks.Authorities have banned large gatherings in Delhi and suspended internet services in several Haryana districts ahead of the March to Delhi, called by farmers from Punjab and Haryana along with several other northern states.

Here is more to know about the protest:Who is participating?
Aside from organisations from Punjab and Haryana, unions from the states of Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh are also participating in the march as they demand government intervention to help the ailing agriculture sector, which is central to the country’s food security.

The Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), Kisan Mazdoor Morcha (KMM) and Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee are spearheading the protests. The organisers said more than 200 farm unions are participating in the March to Delhi.

The SKM played a key role in the 2020-2021 protests that forced Prime Minister Narendra Modi to repeal three farm laws that farmers feared would have benefitted corporations at their expense. Farmers have accused Modi’s government of failing to fulfill its promises to farmers since then, including doubling their incomes.The SKM has called for a nationwide rural and industrial strike to express disapproval of the government.

What are the farmers’ demands?
The farmers are demanding legal guarantees of a minimum support price (MSP), which acts as a safety net for the farming community; waivers of farm loans; and a rollback of policies they say hurt farmers.

The MSP, which is the cost at which the government purchases crops from farmers, provides farmers with an assured income for their produce amid market uncertainties.

The demand is for the MSP to be fixed at least 50 percent higher than the cost of production of any crop.

Farmers are agitating against the planned privatisation of the electricity sector. State governments currently provide subsidised electricity to farmers, which helps bring input costs down.

They are also demanding compensation for the farmers who died during the 2020-2021 protests.

“There have been around 750 martyrs during the struggle,” said Vijoo Krishnan, the general secretary of the All India Kisan Sabha, an organisation participating in the current protests.


Another demand is the dismissal of a federal minister whose son was accused of running his car over farmers in Uttar Pradesh’s Lakhimpur Kheri district in October 2021.

The protests also seek to ensure that the promises made by Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in 2021 are acted on.

“The three acts have been withdrawn, but BJP-ruled states are trying to bring them through the backdoor. Even the recent budget has sought to privatise post-harvest activities,” Krishnan said.

Modi’s government formed a committee to address farming issues, but it failed to include representatives from Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, all major grain producers. The committee has hardly made any progress.

In the meantime, farmers continue to struggle with longtime problems. Debt due to crop failures causes thousands of Indian farmers to take their lives every year. Agriculture output has been reduced by extreme weather and dwindling water sources caused by climate change.

How has the BJP government responded?
A government delegation has held negotiations with the protesting farmers, but the talks have not yielded results. On Tuesday, Indian police tear-gassed and detained some farmers who clashed with them at the border between Haryana and Punjab. Police also dropped canisters of tear gas from a drone at one of the border points in northern Haryana state that leads to Delhi.

Devinder Sharma, an Indian agricultural expert, pointed out that farmers have been cut off from the capital as Delhi’s and Haryana’s borders have been fortified by authorities.

“How can we keep them away from the country? From the capital? From the decision-making?” he asked.

What were the 2020-2021 protests about?
During the earlier protests, farmers protested against laws passed by the BJP government that allowed farmers to sell produce directly to bulk buyers and make contract farming easier.

While Modi said the laws were aimed at liberating the farmers, they prompted the resignation of Harsimrat Kaur Badal, the food processing minister, who called the legislation “anti-farmer”. Modi was forced to withdraw the three farm laws in 2021.

In 2022, Modi’s administration promised it would set up a panel of farmers and state officials to find ways to ensure support prices for all farm produce. Farmers have accused the BJP government of lagging behind on that promise.

What impact will the protests have on the Indian elections?
The march comes months before a general election, which the BJP is expected to win.

“We don’t know how this protest proceeds and if it results in workable solutions,” Sharma said, adding, “If it lingers on, then only will it have an impact on the election.”

Farmers comprise two-thirds of India’s 1.4 billion people, accounting for nearly a fifth of the country’s gross domestic product, according to government figures. Hence, farmers form an influential voting bloc, and parties try to gain their support.

Krishnan said the BJP is being condemned for its “anti-farmer and anti-worker policies”.

As it seeks the farmers’ votes, the Modi government last week conferred the nation’s highest civilian honour on former Prime Minister and agriculture leader Chaudhury Charan Singh and MS Swaminathan, a pioneer of the agricultural revolution in the 1960s and ’70s.

New Delhi:
A petition has been filed in the Supreme Court alleging violation of the rights of the ""peacefully protesting"" farmers by the Centre and some states.
The petition claimed the Centre and some states have issued ""threats"" and fortified the national capital's borders, after several farmer unions called protests seeking legal guarantee for minimum support price (MSP) for their crops and implementation of the Swaminathan committee's recommendations.
""The petitioner is seeking a writ of mandamus in the interest of the farmers who are facing unfair treatment in their peaceful protests,"" said the petition filed by Agnostos Theos, Managing Director of the Sikh Chamber of Commerce.
It claimed some of the protesters were forcibly arrested or detained by various state governments, and the Centre has unduly invoked prohibitory measures, including blocking social media accounts, rerouting traffic and blocking roads.
It alleged the governments of Haryana, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh have employed ""aggressive and violent measures"", like using tear gas, rubber bullets and pellets against the farmers, causing serious injuries.
In the absence of medical aid, the injuries were aggravated and also caused deaths, the plea claimed, adding that fortifications at Delhi's borders have created a ""hostile and violent situation"", and did not allow the farmers to exercise their democratic right to protest.
""The peaceful farmers have been subject to conditions similar to terrorists by their own government, simply for the exercise of their democratic and constitutional rights,"" it said.
The petitioner sought a direction against the Centre, the four states and the National Human Rights Commission to ""consider the reasonable demands of the farmers from across India, who are in continuous peaceful protest, demonstration and agitation"".
It also sought directions to the respondents to ensure ""fair and respectful treatment of the protesting farmers"", besides allowing free movement.
The petition sought a report about alleged human rights violations by police, besides adequate compensation for the victim farmers and their families.

9/6/2024,Farm crisis looms as monsoon extends its welcome into October harvest season,"The 2024 monsoon season has been extremely unpredictable as the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) forecasts it could extend into October. The monsoon, it seems, has lost its rhythm, extending its stay well beyond its traditional September farewell. However, experts claim this year's extended monsoon is not an anomaly. It has been a slow trend in the making for over a decade.This shift in monsoon patterns has left farmers and policymakers grappling with the consequences of erratic rains, flooding, and damage to crops, highlighting the urgent need for adapting agricultural practices to this new climate reality. According to climatologists, the southwest monsoon onset and withdrawal have become slow. This has led to heavier-than-expected rainfall in northern and western parts of the country.

Flooding
Extreme weather events have led to increased flooding. (Photo: PTI)
Western states like Gujarat and Rajasthan have witnessed a staggering 30% increase in rainfall over the last decade, with heavy downpours becoming more frequent. In these arid and semi-arid regions, this shift from moderate monsoons to bouts of heavy rainfall has caused major disruptions, leading to floods and crop damage.

""One of the most notable changes is the extension of rains into October, especially in the Indo-Gangetic plains. Regions in Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Jharkhand, which typically prepare for harvest in early October, are now receiving unseasonal rains, delaying harvests and threatening the quality of crops like rice, maize, and pulses,"" said Vishwas Chitale, Senior Programme Lead at Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW).

WHAT'S DRIVING THIS MONSOON CHANGE

Climate change is intensifying monsoon patterns in India, leading to more erratic and extreme rainfall.

Warmer ocean temperatures and atmospheric changes are increasing moisture levels, resulting in heavier downpours and flooding. El Nino and La Nina events further amplify this volatility.While El Niño initially weakened monsoons, causing droughts in some regions, La Nina leads to excessive rains and floods. These oscillating weather patterns, combined with the broader effects of climate change, are worsening the unpredictability of monsoons, and disrupting agriculture, water management, and daily life across India.

INDIA's FOOD SECURITY AT STAKE

Kharif crops, which rely on a well-timed retreat of the monsoon, are particularly vulnerable to this extended rainy season.

The Ministry of Agriculture recently reported that 408.72 lakh hectares of paddy were sown in 2024, up from 393.57 lakh hectares the previous year.

However, with excess rain-soaking fields meant for harvest, the bumper sowing might not translate into a good yield. The risk of crop losses is heightened by the fact that rain-fed crops like paddy and maize are highly sensitive to moisture levels during their critical harvest period.This shifting monsoon pattern has become a growing concern for India’s farming community, especially in regions where rain-fed agriculture dominates.

The unpredictability of the rains and their increasing intensity have already had a significant impact on crop production.

Between 2015-16 and 2021-22, hydro-meteorological calamities like floods and heavy rainfall damaged 33.9 million hectares of cropped area, according to data from the Ministry of Agriculture.

""Increased rainfall in western India could lead to more frequent and intense flooding. However, the existing water management infrastructure is insufficient to handle these surges, often resulting in pluvial floods during extreme rainfall. Sustainable approaches, like integrating surface and groundwater use, are necessary to mitigate these effects,"" Dr Kasiapillai S. Kasiviswanathan Associate Professor at the Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee, told IndiaToday.in.

With extreme weather events like flooding becoming more common, experts emphasise the need for climate-resilient agricultural practices.

Diversifying crops, improving drainage systems, and adopting drought- and flood-resistant varieties are just some of the strategies that could help mitigate the impact of erratic monsoons.

12/26/2024,"EV funding in India drops 37% from 2022 to 2024 amid policy, sales slowdown","India’s electric vehicle (EV) sector has witnessed a sharp decline in funding, dropping from $934 million in 2022 to $586 million in 2024, according to a report by The Economic Times citing Venture Intelligence data.
 
This decline, attributed to policy changes and slower sales growth, has driven investors to prioritise unit economics and profitability before committing capital. While the number of deals in 2024 remained steady at 44, the funding volume highlights a ‘cautious investment approach’, the news report said.
Transition from FAME-II to PM-E drive scheme
Government policies have always played a pivotal role in shaping the trajectory of the EV sector. The PM-E drive scheme, introduced in October, replaces the FAME-II programme and aims to phase out subsidies gradually. Under the new policy, incentives for electric two-wheelers are capped at Rs 5,000 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) for the first year, with a maximum subsidy of Rs 10,000 per vehicle. 
 
 
In contrast, FAME-II had provided higher incentives of Rs 15,000 per kWh, covering up to 40 per cent of a vehicle’s cost, which was later reduced to Rs 10,000 per kWh in 2023.
 
The PM-E drive scheme notably excludes subsidies for electric four-wheelers and hybrid vehicles, a move that has impacted original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) significantly.Major deals amid reduced investor confidence
Despite the overall decline in funding, the sector saw a few high-profile investments. Ather Energy secured $71 million from the National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF), attaining unicorn status and setting the stage for an upcoming IPO. However, such large deals have become exceptions in a more cautious funding environment.
Slower growth in EV sales
The growth rate in EV sales has also decelerated. While over 1.9 million EVs were sold in 2024 — representing a 24.5 per cent increase from 1.5 million in 2023 — this marks a significant slowdown compared to the 50 per cent growth seen between 2022 and 2023. Data from the government’s Vahan platform indicates that the electric two-wheeler segment, which includes companies like Ola Electric, accounted for 1.13 million of these sales in 2024, up from 860,000 units in 2023, the report said.
 
Despite challenges, the Indian government’s target of 30 per cent EV penetration in new vehicle registrations by 2030 continues to drive optimism. Investors are shifting focus to emerging areas such as component manufacturing, battery swapping, charging infrastructure, and financing. These segments are gaining traction and attracting fresh capital.
 
Battery swapping, in particular, has seen notable growth. The Economic Times report quoted Pulkit Khurana, co-founder of Battery Smart, saying there has been a rising adoption of battery swapping in commercial applications like quick commerce and food delivery.
 
Battery Smart surpassed 55 million swaps last month and is conducting over 100,000 swaps daily, he said. Battery Smart raised $65 million at a $340 million valuation in a funding round led by LeapFrog Investments in June.

What is the PM-E drive subsidy scheme for EVs?
The PM Electric Drive Revolution in Innovative Vehicle Enhancement (PM-E drive) scheme was launched on October 1, 2024, with a budget of Rs 10,900 crore. This initiative aims to accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) by providing demand incentives for various categories, including electric two-wheelers (e-2Ws), three-wheelers (e-3Ws), e-buses, and e-ambulances, among others. The scheme will run until March 31, 2026, and also focuses on establishing essential charging infrastructure and enhancing the domestic EV manufacturing ecosystem.
 
To streamline the subsidy process, an e-voucher system has been introduced. Customers will receive an Aadhaar-authenticated e-voucher at the time of purchase, which will reduce the upfront cost of their EV. This e-voucher can be downloaded via a link sent to the customer’s registered mobile number.",India,https://www.business-standard.com/industry/auto/india-ev-sector-funding-decline-policy-impact-pm-e-drive-2024-124122600287_1.html,
3/15/2024,Why is India’s Modi pushing for simultaneous elections? Who would gain?,"India has moved a step towards holding simultaneous elections for parliament, state legislatures and local bodies that could end the country’s relentless cycle of voting – about six states go to polls each year.

A nine-member high-level panel headed by former President Ram Nath Kovind on Thursday recommended amendments to the constitution to hold national and regional polls together.The move, supporters, say will save time and money while allowing political parties and governments to focus on policy and administration. However, critics say it would go against the federal structure and spirit of the Indian constitution, cloud local issues that get attention when state elections are held separately, and potentially turn all votes subsumed in the giant election exercise into a prime ministerial contest.

The panel’s recommendation won’t have any bearing on the national elections which will kick off in a few days — but the coming vote could set the stage for the plan’s execution five years from now.

Here’s what the controversy is about:

The idea to bring the practice back to India is not new. The Law Commission, which provides advice to the government, had recommended simultaneous polls in 1999 — a quarter of a century ago.

Since he came to power in 2014, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been pitching the idea in public forums.

What are the key recommendations?
The panel in its 18,626-page report has outlined a phased approach to synchronise elections — beginning first with elections for the lower house of parliament or Lok Sabha and state assemblies, followed by elections to local bodies within 100 days of general polls.

The president of India will notify a date for the first sitting of the Lok Sabha after a general election. This date will mark the new electoral cycle.The tenure of all state assemblies formed after that date will be curtailed to coincide with the subsequent general elections.

In the event of a hung house and a no-confidence motion, new elections will be held to constitute the new lower house of parliament or state assembly — but only for the remainder of the five-year term.

What would be needed to hold joint polls?
The move to hold simultaneous elections for the Lok Sabha and assemblies can be done by amending the constitution, without having to get it endorsed by state legislatures.

But for synchronising votes for local bodies with general elections, amendments to the constitution will need the ratification of at least half of India’s 28 states.

The elections will also involve common electoral rolls and a single voter identity card for all polls.

Conducting simultaneous elections is possible, but the Election Commission of India will need three times as many electronic voting machines as it currently has, said SY Quraishi, former chief election commissioner.

It will also need many more than the 15 million polling staff and security personnel currently used for national elections, he said.

What are the arguments for and against this move?
Of the 47 political parties that gave their opinions to the panel, 32 supported the idea, while 15 opposed it.

The main opposition Congress party told the panel that implementing simultaneous elections would result in “substantial changes to the basic structure of the constitution”, go against “the guarantees of federalism” and “subvert parliamentary democracy”.The All India Trinamool Congress, which rules in the eastern state of West Bengal, said forcing state assemblies to hold premature elections just for the sake of simultaneous votes would be unconstitutional and would ultimately lead to suppression of state issues.

Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has supported the concept by arguing that about 800 days of governance are effectively lost over five years. Ahead of every election, the election commission announces what is known as the Model Code of Conduct: After that declaration, until the elections are over, relevant governments can’t enforce any new policies that might affect voter choices.

Simultaneous elections will spur growth, cool inflation and avoid disruption of supply chains, while also optimising resources spent on polling and encouraging large-scale voter participation, the panel has said.

But Quraishi, India’s former election commissioner, argued that if many state assemblies are dissolved early just for them to hold new elections at the same time as the national vote, that would actually increase the total number of elections. And not just in the short run: If governments fall, and new elections are held for held for truncated tenures, that too would increase the total number of elections.

“It’s not a very brilliant idea,” Quraishi said.

Trilochan Sastry, founding member of the Association of Democratic Reforms, a group that advocates for greater political transparency and accountability, echoed Quraishi’s worries. And if India wants to cut the rising cost of elections, it can do so by capping campaign spending by parties, Sastry said.

Simultaneous polls could also give an advantage to the party ruling at the national level, said Quraishi.

According to a study by the IDFC Institute, a think tank, there is a 77 percent chance an Indian voter would support the same party at the federal and state level if elections are held simultaneously.

Political accountability activists also argue that frequent elections might actually be good — they put pressure on governments and parties to stay on their toes and remain sensitive to voter concerns.

“We are living with the current system of frequent elections,” said Sastry. “Now if you suddenly change the system, we have to examine all implications and hold wider consultations.”

What is the price for holding polls together?
Elections in India are costly affairs – the world’s most expensive.

Election expenditure by political parties and candidates for simultaneous polls could be 10 trillion rupees ($121bn) for five years starting in 2024, said N Bhaskara Rao, chairman of the New Delhi-based Centre for Media Studies. Of these, 1.2 trillion rupees ($14.5bn) will be spent for this year’s general elections. Most of this spending is unaccounted for.

About 3 to 5 trillion rupees could be saved if simultaneous elections idea is adopted, said Rao.

The panel said simultaneous elections could help a 1.5 percentage point increase in GDP, which is equivalent to 4.5 trillion rupees ($54bn) in the financial year 2024, half of the public spending on health, and one-third of that on education.Still, some argue that costs alone can’t be a determining factor for holding all polls together. The Congress party told the panel that the “argument that cost of conducting elections are extremely high seems baseless” and described it as “the cost of free and fair elections to uphold democracy”.

Can it become a reality?
Very possibly, if Modi’s BJP-led coalition comes to power with a clear majority after the April and May parliamentary elections. Ratification by states won’t be difficult as the BJP alone controls 12 of India’s 28 states and has allies ruling several others.

The BJP is in pole position for the 2024 general elections. Opinion polls suggest the BJP-led alliance will win with a clear majority.

Attacking the BJP leadership, Trinamool Congress national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee said that migratory leaders those who come to West Bengal from outside should be given a right answer by the electorate in defeating the saffron party in the last two phases of the ongoing Lok Sabha polls. 
Speaking at a public rally at Joynagar in South 24 Parganas in support of party candidate Pratima Mondal, Mr. Banerjee alleged that the outsiders who come to the state are not aware of the rich tradition and culture of West Bengal. 
“The migratory leaders who come to West Bengal to seek votes should be given the right lesson. They don’t have the slightest idea of the tradition and culture of the state”, Mr. Banerjee, also the nephew of Trinamool Congress supremo Mamata Banerjee, said. - PTI

1/5/2024,Winter storm hammers eastern US; over 60 million face blizzard conditions,"A severe winter storm has hammered the United States, with meteorologists warning more than 60 million people in the country’s east faced blizzard conditions and some areas would see the heaviest snowfall in a decade.

The National Weather Service (NWS) on Sunday warned of ice, snow and gale-force winds in states from the central plains to the mid-Atlantic.

A state of emergency has been declared in Kentucky, Missouri and Virginia.

More than 60 million people are in the path of the dangerous storm, set to plunge the eastern half of the US into a deep freeze of Arctic air through Monday, resulting in severe travel disruptions.

Winter storm warnings have been issued from western Kansas to the coastal states of Maryland, Delaware and Virginia, an unusually broad 2,400km (1,500-mile) swath under immediate threat.

“Disruptive winter storm to impact the Central Plains to the Mid-Atlantic through Monday with widespread heavy snow and damaging ice accumulations,” the NWS said in its latest report.

The agency warned that areas from northeastern Kansas to north-central Missouri would see “the heaviest snowfall in a decade”.

Scientists say extreme weather is becoming more common and more severe as a result of man-made climate change.

Flights disrupted
The first major storm of 2025 was already wreaking havoc on travel, with Kansas City International Airport announcing closure of its flight operations Saturday “due to rapid ice accumulation”.

Flight operations resumed later after airfield runways and taxiways were treated, Kansas City mayor Quinton Lucas said in a social media post.Temperatures are expected to plunge, in some places to below zero degrees Fahrenheit (-18 Celsius) while the US capital Washington could be blanketed in five inches or more of snow.

Another major concern is freezing rain and sleet expected from Kansas eastward to Kentucky and Virginia, setting the stage for thick ice to coat roads, making travel hazardous, bringing down trees and electricity lines, and potentially leaving millions of customers without power during a cold snap.

Conditions could prove especially perilous in the Appalachians, where a deadly hurricane in late September devastated communities and ravaged multiple southeastern states including Kentucky.

Many of those communities are still recovering from the effects of that hurricane.

The new storm “will likely cause significant disruption and dangerous conditions on our roads and could cause significant power outages just 24 hours or so before it’s going to get really cold in Kentucky”, Governor Andy Beshear told an emergency meeting.

 11/08/2024,COP29: Deadly weather events show cost of climate inaction,"Record-breaking floods in Spain, violent storms in Florida and wildfires in South America – these are just a few examples of the extreme weather events accelerating and intensifying across the world. With the cost of inaction clearer than ever, financing for clean alternatives to the fossil fuels which are driving climate change will be top of the agenda at this year’s UN climate conference, COP29.
The context in which COP29 begins in Baku, Azerbaijan on November 11 is critical but not hopeless.

A UN climate report released just days before the Conference confirmed that global average temperature rise is approaching 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, which would put the world on course for a catastrophic rise of 2.6-3.1°C this century, unless there are immediate and major cuts to greenhouse gas emissions.

A failure to act will lead to increasingly frequent and dangerous extreme weather events.

The UN is calling for urgent collective action, led by the G20 group of developed economies and the biggest emitters, to deliver the greenhouse gas emissions cuts needed to limit global warming.

What is the UN Climate Change Conference?

The climate crisis transcends borders. Solving it requires unprecedented international cooperation, with the UN and its chief, the Secretary-General, at the centre of the multilateral effort.The annual UN Climate Change Conferences (otherwise known, in UN jargon, as COPs, or Conferences of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change), are the world’s primary multilateral decision-making forum on climate change, bringing together almost every country on Earth. 

They are unique opportunities for the world to come together to agree on how to address the climate crisis, limit the global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius, help vulnerable communities to adapt to the changing climate, and achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.

COPs are meant to be inclusive affairs and, as well as world leaders and government representatives, a diverse range of people from all aspects of society, from business leaders and climate scientists to Indigenous Peoples and youth, are involved, taking part in order to share insights and best practices to strengthen climate action that benefits all.

What is the focus of COP29?

A top priority for negotiators in Baku will be agreeing on a new climate finance goal, one that ensures every country has the means to take much stronger climate action, slash greenhouse gas emissions and build resilient communities. The aim is for the conference to help unlock the trillions of dollars that developing countries need in order to mitigate harmful carbon emissions, adapt to climate change and cope with the loss and damage it has caused.

Look out for a continuation of discussions held at the UN Summit of the Future earlier this year on reforming the international financial architecture. The UN Secretary-General, António Guterres has described the current system as “entirely unfit for purpose” and ill-equipped to cope with today’s challenges:  many poor countries are facing unsustainable levels of debt that leave them unable to invest in social protection and health care, let alone measures that would bring about the transition to a low carbon economy.

What will happen over the two weeks?

As ever, there will be a packed schedule of negotiations, speeches, press conferences, events and panel discussions at the conference site, divided into a Green Zone – which is overseen by the COP29 Presidency and open to the general public – and a Blue Zone managed by the UN.This is where the nitty-gritty of the negotiations will take place, as the representatives of the nations of the world try to thrash out a deal by the end of the event. An agreement is usually reached, but not without drama, with last minute disagreements pushing the talks beyond their official deadline.

Why are COPs important?

The importance of COPs lies in their convening power: the decisions made at each of them may not go as far as some may hope, in terms of addressing the climate crisis, but they are made by consensus, uniting the countries of the world in international agreements that set standards and advance action in critical areas.In 2015, at COP21 in Paris, a landmark climate agreement was reached in which countries agreed to reduce global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5 degrees. The Paris Agreement works on a five- year cycle of increasingly ambitious climate action by countries. The next updated national climate action plans - known as Nationally Determined Contributions, or NDCs - are due in 2025. This process has led to incremental but important improvements, in terms of reduced emissions and measures to promote the adoption of renewable energy sources.

Each year, negotiators build on progress made at the previous year’s COP, strengthening aspirations and commitments, and pushing for new agreements, based on the latest scientific findings on the climate, and the role of human activity in the crisis.

What comes next?Beyond the conference walls, there are many positive signs that the clean energy transition is gathering pace, and already paying huge dividends, in terms of the creation of jobs and boosting the economies that are embracing it.

Renewables are entering the energy system at an unprecedented rate, and electricity from new wind and solar power is now cheaper in most places than electricity from fossil fuels.

A future powered by renewable energy is now inevitable. Those who take decisive action and invest in clean technologies today are expected to reap the biggest rewards in the years to come.

Even before the end of COP29, delegates will be ironing out the details of their improved national climate plans, which amongst other targets will focus on transitioning away from fossil fuels, and keeping the world on track to a no more than 1.5 degree increase in global temperatures.",Global,https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1156691,#VALUE!
11/11/2024,COP29 Azerbaijan: What’s at stake at the 2024 global climate summit?,"The UN annual climate summit is now under way in Azerbaijan’s capital Baku, with thousands of representatives from the world converging in the South Caucasus nation for two weeks of negotiations over how to tackle the climate crisis.

But the global summit has been overshadowed by the re-election of Donald Trump as United States president, who has expressed his intention to walk out of the landmark Paris Agreement for the second time. He is also likely to reduce the US’s carbon-cutting commitments critical in the transition to net zero. Countries have also failed to agree on how to fund the transition towards green energy and climate change mitigation programmes around the world.

Here is what you need to know:

When and where is the COP29 being held?
COP29 will take place in Azerbaijan’s capital city, Baku, between November 11-22.

The decision to host the summit in a country whose economy is based on fossil fuels has been criticised by climate activists, including Greta Thunberg, who labelled the event a “greenwash conference” during a recent lecture.

What does COP stand for?
COP is an abbreviation for the Conference of the Parties to the Convention, which refers to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) – a multilateral treaty adopted in 1992.

The UNFCCC, which entered into force in 1994, has become a basis for landmark agreements such as the Kyoto Protocol (1997) and the Paris Climate Agreement (2015), which aims to limit global temperature rise to 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels by 2100.


The first COP summit was held in the German capital Berlin in 1995.

Who will participate?
More than 32,000 people have registered to attend the COP29 this year.

These will include representatives from all 198 countries that have ratified the convention.

It will also mark the first time the Taliban will attend a UN climate conference since their takeover of Afghanistan in 2021.

Diplomats, journalists, climate scientists, NGOs, activists, and Indigenous leaders will also attend.

The Biden administration will send a delegation with officials from more than 20 US departments, agencies, and organisations led by senior adviser to the president for international climate policy, John Podesta.

The delegation will participate in the talks but will be unable to make any clear financial commitments as Trump is set to take office in January.

What’s on the agenda this year?
COP29 has been labelled the “finance COP” because it seeks to increase funding to support lower-income countries in reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

A UN-backed report has stated that emerging countries, excluding China, need investments well beyond $2 trillion annually by 2030 if the world is to halt global warming.

Who should foot that bill has caused divisions before.

An analysis commissioned by the UK and Egypt found that a trillion dollars should come from rich countries, investors, and multilateral development banks.

The report added the remainder – about $1.4 trillion – must originate domestically from private and public sources.

In 2009, richer nations pledged to provide $100bn annually in climate financing for developing countries by 2020, which they achieved two years late.

The world’s poorer nations are now calling for a new goal of at least $1 trillion per year.

Current donors are urging nations such as China – the world’s largest annual emitter of greenhouse gases – and the UAE – a major fossil fuel producer – which are still classified as developing to contribute to the fund.

Agreements on the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) from all participating countries will be high on the agenda.

An NDC is a country’s national climate action plan that sets out its targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in line with the goals set in the Paris Agreement.


NDCs must be updated every five years, and with the next round due in early 2025, this year’s summit presents the perfect opportunity to finalise each member’s goals.

What progress has been made since last year’s summit?
The headline agreement that came out of the COP28 in Dubai, UAE was to “transition away from fossil fuels” as part of the global stocktake.

It was an important milestone as it was the first-ever COP text to openly call on countries to wean themselves off fossil fuels.

At this stage, it is hard to tell whether there has been significant progress, as the target for energy-related emissions to reach net zero was set for 2050. Two goals, including tripling global renewable energy capacity and doubling global energy efficiency improvements, were set for 2030.

In April, the International Energy Agency (IEA) set up a tracker to measure the goals set at COP28.

Why is the central pledge made at COP28 not part of the agenda this year?
There has been no official reason stated.

However, focusing on fossil fuels may have been difficult because oil and gas make up roughly half of Azerbaijan’s economy and account for 90 percent of its exports.

An advocacy group also secretly recorded Elnur Soltanov, Azerbaijan’s deputy energy minister and CEO of COP29, offering to facilitate talks about new fossil fuel deals before the summit.

How will Trump’s election affect the summit agenda?
Donald Trump’s recent election as US president will not directly alter this year’s summit agenda, but it could affect the implementation of any agreements when he is inaugurated in January 2025.

Trump pulled the US from the Paris Agreement, fulfilling his promise to withdraw from the global pact. His successor, President Joe Biden, signed the US back into the agreement in 2021.

As the world’s second-largest emitter of greenhouse gases after China, a US withdrawal from the pact would have huge consequences for any targets agreed upon at COP29.

Last year, the US produced an average of 12.9 million barrels of crude oil per day, breaking a previous global record in 2019.

Trump has also regularly questioned whether climate change is real and downplayed its effects.

How did climate change affect the world in 2024?
The EU’s Copernicus Climate Change Service has stated that its scientists are “virtually certain” that 2024 will be the warmest year on record.

The year was also marked by extreme weather events, with scientists linking storms such as Hurricane Milton, which swept across Florida and killed at least 18 people, to climate change.

World Food Safety 2024: Here Are 5 Tips To Ensure Food Safety At Home:
 1. Maintain Hygiene:
After each cooking session, ensure thorough washing of hands, utensils, countertops, and gas stoves. Regular daily cleaning with deeper cleans every few days inhibits bacterial growth. This simple practice significantly reduces the risk of foodborne illnesses. 
2. Handle Raw Foods with Care:
Raw foods, such as meats and seafood, are breeding grounds for harmful bacteria. Keep them refrigerated at all times and separate from cooked foods to prevent cross-contamination. This precaution minimizes the spread of pathogens and maintains food freshness. 
3. Fortify Kitchen Defenses:
Pests like insects and rodents can carry diseases and contaminate food. Ensure all kitchen outlets leading outdoors are tightly sealed to prevent their entry. Additionally, install protective nets on windows to create an additional barrier against small insects. These measures safeguard your kitchen environment and protect your family's health.
4. Maintain Produce Purity:
Even organic produce can harbour harmful bacteria and pesticides. Wash fruits and vegetables thoroughly under running water before consumption, regardless of their source. This simple step eliminates surface contaminants and reduces the risk of foodborne illnesses.
5. Master Precision Cooking:
Cooking food to the correct internal temperature is crucial for killing harmful bacteria. Use a food thermometer to ensure meats, poultry, seafood, and other perishables reach safe cooking temperatures. This practice guarantees that your meals are not only delicious but also safe for consumption.
Practising Food Safety In Restaurants:
If you run a restaurant or hotel kitchen, it is important to provide safe and hygienic food to your guests/customers. We asked industry leaders how they practice food safety in their kitchens.
Chef Manisha Bhasin, Corporate Executive chef, ITC Hotels, told us, ""At ITC Hotels we ensure 100% food safety by following the best Industry practices across all our brands. Once the ingredients reach our kitchens, they go through a number of rigorous procedures including food storage temperature controls, food segregation, allergen protocols, staff and food-handlers hygiene, well-maintained food production premises and many more.

11/1/2024,"UN Report Wars Of Famine, Aggravated By Conflicts And Climate Shocks","FAO and WFP experts believe that the conflict in Sudan is likely to expand, ""driving mass displacement""
Severe food crises threaten hundreds of thousands of people in vulnerable areas, including the Palestinian territories, Sudan, South Sudan, Haiti, and Mali, where populations face or near famine, says a report by the United Nations' food agencies released on Thursday.
Conflicts, economic instability, and climate shocks -- combined with reduced funding for emergency food and agriculture assistance -- are driving alarming levels of acute food insecurity, the report warned.
â€œImmediate, scaled-up intervention is needed to prevent further deterioration in these already vulnerable regions,' it added.
The UN Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Food Programme said acute food insecurity is projected to worsen across 16 â€œhunger hotspotsâ€ during the next six months in 14 countries and two regions.
Sudan, South Sudan, Haiti, Mali and the Palestinian territories remain at the â€œhighest concern level', the report said.
Chad, Lebanon, Myanmar, Mozambique, Nigeria, the Syrian Arab Republic and Yemen are classified as â€œhotspots of very high concern,â€ where large numbers of people are facing or are projected to face critical levels of acute food insecurity.
â€œConflict and armed violence continue to be the primary drivers of hunger in numerous hotspots, disrupting food systems, displacing populations, and obstructing humanitarian access,â€ the report warned.
FAO and WFP experts believe that the conflict in Sudan is likely to expand, â€œdriving mass displacement, resulting in famine levels likely to persist and the number of people in catastrophic conditions to increase.â€
That will further aggravate the regional humanitarian crisis, resulting in increased cross-border movements to neighbouring countries, primarily Chad, South Sudan, Egypt, Libya, Ethiopia and the Central African Republic.
The UN agencies also stressed that the ongoing conflict in the Palestinian territories has driven 'unprecedented needs, with near-total displacement of the population and an increased risk of regional spillover'.
In Lebanon, the ongoing escalation of conflict is significantly increasing the number of people requiring humanitarian assistance and is severely impacting levels of acute food insecurity, they added.
Since the last report in May 2024, Kenya, Lesotho, Namibia and the Niger have been added to the hunger hotspots list, partly due to the impact of climate extremes.
Beyond conflict, weather extremes and increased climate variability are exacerbating acute food insecurity in many regions, the report said.
La NiÃ±a -- a natural climate pattern that influences global weather marked by cooler ocean temperatures in the equatorial Pacific is expected to persist through March 2025, with a significant impact on rainfall patterns and temperatures.
'While La NiÃ±a may enhance agricultural prospects in some areas, it also increases the risk of flooding in parts of Nigeria, Malawi, Mozambique, South Sudan, Zambia and Zimbabwe,'the report said.
The UN agencies warned that without 'immediate humanitarian efforts and concerted international action' to address severe constraints and advocate for the de-escalation of conflicts, further starvation and loss of life are likely in Palestine, the Sudan, South Sudan, Haiti and Mali.
'Addressing and preventing famine in these regions will require greater investment in integrated solutions that cut across traditional mandates, targeting the root causes of food insecurity and reducing dependency on emergency aid',they said.

12/15/2024,The 24 hours of rate cuts that end year of global central-bank easing,"By Craig Stirling
 
A year when inflation subsided enough for monetary policy easing to start in most advanced economies is about to conclude with a 24-hour flurry of decisions led by the Federal Reserve.
 
The US announcement will take centre stage on Wednesday, followed by peers in Japan, the Nordics and, the UK  — amounting to half of the world’s 10 most-traded currency jurisdictions.
 
Those events will draw most attention among investors bracing for the last big week for monetary policy in 2024. By Friday, at least 22 central banks accounting for two-fifths of the global economy will have set borrowing costs.While the Fed itself is poised to deliver a quarter-point rate cut, the dawn of 2025 and the prospect of inflationary import tariffs threatened by the incoming administration of Donald Trump may give officials pause about the pace of further moves.The Bank of England, mindful both of the growth shock his trade policies could cause but also of lingering price pressures, is reducing borrowing costs only cautiously and is widely expected to keep them on hold on Thursday. 
 
The Bank of Japan having exited negative rates this year, will probably wait until 2025 before raising again. 

 
Elsewhere, key data on the health of China’s economy, a likely pickup in UK inflation and business surveys from the euro zone may be among highlights.
 
While the Fed’s preferred gauge of underlying inflation will be released at the end of the week, officials can take take some comfort in projections that price pressures are cooling.
 
The November personal consumption expenditures price index, excluding food and energy, will probably rise 0.2 per cent — the smallest advance in three months — economists forecast Friday’s report to show. The report is also seen showing solid consumer spending and income growth, suggesting a resilient economy.

 
In Canada, Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland will release a long-delayed Budget update amid speculation she has broken her promise to keep the deficit at or below Canadian$40.1 billion. 
 
The week will begin with a slew of data from China that will be closely monitored for signs that the world’s second largest economy is being lifted by government stimulus efforts. Industrial production and retail sales data will be key to watch. 
 
PMI numbers from Australia, India and Japan are also scheduled for release on Monday, to give another feel for growth in the wider region. 
 
Elsewhere in central banking, Pakistan is expected to start off the week with a rate cut after inflation eased, and on Wednesday the Bank of Thailand is projected to keep its benchmark rates unchanged at 2.25 per cent. 

 
Indonesia and the Philippines are both expected to cut borrowing costs by 25 basis points. 
 
Meanwhile, South Korea’s central bank vowed to stabilize financial markets and highlighted the importance of “uninterrupted implementation” of key fiscal and economic measures, in its first statement since lawmakers voted to impeach President Yoon Suk Yeol.
 
On Friday, the Bank of Russia may hike its rate as much as 200 basis points to a record 23 per cent, after data showed consumers price pressures persisting at more than twice the 4 per cent target.
 
In the euro area, survey indicators may focus investors looking at how fallout from political turmoil in France and Germany is impacting businesses. 

 
Turning south, data from Israel from Israel will likely show inflation accelerated to 3.6 per cent in November from 3.5 per cent a month earlier as the war in Gaza strains the economy and the government’s spending soars. That may see its central bank leave rates on hold until the second half of 2025.
