1/27/2021,"After Red Fort Violence, Farmers' Group Calls Off Tractor Rally: 10 Facts","Farmers were seen shouting slogans at the iconic Red Fort.
New Delhi:
Unprecedented chaos was unleashed upon Delhi on the 72nd Republic Day as the tractor rally by protesting farmers went off the designated course and rolled into the Iconic Mughal-era Red Fort in the Old City. A protester died on the way, the police said it was an accident. The farmers entered the forecourt of the fort, climbed its ramparts, and hoisted a religious flag on a mast outside. The police, wielding batons, managed to remove them from inside the fort. The violence started in the morning as farmers broke barricades and entered Delhi ahead of time. One of the key farmer groups has called off the tractor rally, accusing anti-social elements of being responsible for the violence.
Here are 10 developments in this big story:
Union Home minister Amit Shah held a high-level meeting on Tuesday evening where a decision was taken to deploy additional paramilitary forces in Delhi. Punjab and Haryana have been placed under high alert. Internet has been suspended in parts of the National Capital Region -- including Delhi and parts of Uttar Pradesh and Haryana.
The Delhi Police had allowed a rally with a fixed route and time. But the Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee refused to stick to the route. By 8 am, thousands entered the national capital on foot. Dramatic visuals showed farmers breaching barriers at the Singhu border, the epicentre of protests against the farm laws that started on November 26.
Violence broke out at central Delhi's ITO, where the police headquarters is located. A farmer died there as a tractor on way to the Old City overturned, the police said. A bus was vandalized in nearby Akshardham, where the police clashed with protesters. The other flashpoint was Nangloi, where the police used teargas shells. The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation shut the gates at several metro stations.
Visuals from the Red Fort showed farmers hoisting a sacred flag of Sikhs at a second flagpole. Repeated attempts were made to hoist flags on the fort's domes as well. Thousands of others, waving the national flag, stood at the huge gates of the fort. The police have managed to push out protesters from inside the fort. But many are still thronging the Ramlila grounds outside the fort.
""We came here to deliver a message to the Modi government, our job is done. We will go back now,"" one of the farmers told NDTV at the Red Fort. ""We managed to reach the fort even though they tried to stop us. We will not stop till we reach our goal -- the repeal of the three farm laws,"" another farmer said.
The police have filed 15 cases so far. Eight buses and 17 private vehicles were vandalised, the police said. Despite having fixed routes, ""farmers drove tractors off the routes and before the fixed time, leading to vandalism in which many police personnel were injured,"" said Delhi Police chief SN Shrivastava. Overall, 86 police personnel have been injured in the violence.
A key pan-India farmers' group, Samyukt Kisan Morcha, called off the tractor rally, asking participants to return to the protest sites outside Delhi borders. The group also said anti-social elements had ""infiltrated the otherwise peaceful movement"". ""The long struggle for more than 6 months now, and more than 60 days of protest at Delhi borders also seemed to have led to this situation,"" it added.
Farmers were given police permission to hold the rally on the periphery of the city after a court battle. The rally -- to be held over 60-odd-km stretches near the Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur borders -- was expected to enter the city only after the traditional Republic Day parade ended around 11.30 am.
The Centre had opposed the rally in the Supreme Court, contending that its timing will make it ""an embarrassment to the nation"". But the court, which earlier upheld the farmers' right to hold peaceful protests, handed over the matter to the Delhi Police.
No breakthrough in the deadlock over the farm laws has been possible despite 11 rounds of talks between the farmers and the government. The farmers turned down the Centre's last offer to put the laws on hold for 18 months while a special committee conducts negotiations.",New Delhi:,https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/farmers-clash-with-cops-in-heart-of-delhi-drive-tractors-into-red-fort-2358223
4/19/2021,Indian expansion of Covid vaccine drive may further strain supplies,"India has announced it will soon open its vaccination programme to every adult in response to soaring Covid-19 infections – a measure that could further strain supplies in parts of the world reliant on Indian-made vaccines for their own campaigns.

From 1 May, Indian states will be free to administer doses to anyone aged older than 18, the central government announced on Monday as part of a package of policies to tackle a second wave that has overwhelmed hospitals and led to oxygen shortages across the country.

Delhi’s government was one of several local administrations to announce new quarantine measures. The capital’s chief minister, Arvind Kejriwal, said Delhi was facing a “grim” situation and needed to lock down for at least six days from Monday evening.

The daily death toll in India has climbed to more than 1,500, the highest figure since the beginning of the pandemic. Some public health specialists have blamed the surge in infections on a highly infectious “double mutant” variant spreading in cities and villages that had relaxed social distancing after six months of falling caseloads.


India has tried to ramp up the speed of its national vaccination programme in response but is limited by how much its manufacturers can produce. Many vaccination centres have had to ration supplies even though the jab is currently only available to people older than 45.

The government said last week it had a stock of fewer than 27m doses, enough to last about nine days at the current rate of vaccination. Reuters reported on Sunday that the government was likely to agree to give a $30m grant to the Serum Institute of India, the world’s largest vaccine manufacturer, to boost its monthly production capacity to 100m, up from the 50-60m doses it has been producing to date.

Removing age restrictions opens up access to the vaccine to at least 400 million more people, which could mean the government allows Indian manufacturers to export fewer vaccines, including as part of the Covax initiative, a multilateral programme intended to help developing and middle-income countries.

India has already vastly scaled down the amount of vaccines it is shipping abroad, exporting only about 2m doses in past weeks, compared with 64m between January and March.

Shipments to developing countries through the Covax programme have continued but in lower numbers than was projected before the second wave.

The Serum Institute has said its manufacturing capacity is being constrained by a US export ban on raw material products it needs to produce more doses.

“Respected @POTUS, if we are to truly unite in beating this virus, on behalf of the vaccine industry outside the US, I humbly request you to lift the embargo of raw material exports out of the US so that vaccine production can ramp up,” Adar Poonawalla, the chief of the institute, tweeted on Friday. The White House has not responded.

The British prime minister, Boris Johnson, on Monday cancelled an upcoming state visit to Delhi, citing the scale of the outbreak in a statement released with the Indian government.",India,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/19/indian-expansion-of-covid-vaccine-drive-may-further-strain-supplies
4/30/2021,Vaccine shortage dents India's coronavirus adult immunisation drive,"While ramping up COVID-19 vaccination is the most effective way to limit the staggering rate of coronavirus infections and deaths in India, a massive shortage of vaccine doses is hampering the country’s ambitious plan for adult immunisation, being rolled out in trickles today.

On April 28, India opened up registrations for anyone above 18 years of age for the roll out of the nation-wide drive on May 1. However, most states, including capital Delhi, have delayed this third phase of vaccination citing poor stocks. Only six – Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Chattisgarh, Gujarat and Odisha – out of India’s 36 states and union territories were able to open up limited number of vaccinations for all adults. Since the beginning of the phased vaccination drive on 16 January 2021, over 24.5 million people have registered themselves on India government’s online registration platform.

India's health minister Harsh Vardhan tweeted on April 30 that the government had supplied more than 163 million free vaccine doses to states and union territories. Ten million more doses were still available in central stocks, he said. Till now the central government was procuring all vaccine stocks from vaccine manufacturers and distributing them across the country. In the adult immunisation phase beginning today, manufacturers — primarily the Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech — will be able to directly sell 50% of their stocks to state governments and private hospitals.

To make a dent in the progression of the disease, India needs to vaccinate 10 million people a day, according to infectious diseases modeller Gautam Menon, professor of biology and physics at Ashoka University in Sonepat, Haryana.

Public health experts are unanimous that the only way to get to the other side of the pandemic is large scale vaccination. “There is just no other way,” says Polly Roy, a professor of virology in the Department of Infection Biology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.

The immunisation drive will need to be backed by excellent vaccine management strategy, according to Randeep Guleria, Director of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences. “The production of both available vaccines Covishield and Covaxin will be ramped up and we will soon have more players in the field,” he says.

However, Jacob John, a professor of community health at the Christian Medical College (CMC) in Vellore says the government’s decision to open up vaccinations for those above 18 years of age is not evidence-based given that less than 20% of those above 45 years of age have been vaccinated by the second phase. “The primary target for vaccination should be those over 45 years and those living in the dense urban areas,” he says.

At current manufacturing rates, India may have sufficient vaccines for those above 45 years by July or August, John says. “But this was possible only if we did not open the vaccinations just now for those below 45 years of age. Public policies cannot be run by emotions, there has to be equity and an overall efficiency factor while mapping a policy like this.”

Vaccines are a great investment, says virologist Gagandeep Kang, a professor in the Department of Gastrointestinal Sciences at CMC, Vellore. “We should endeavour to get as many vaccines developed and used as possible.” Since this is India’s first ever adult immunization programme, more efforts need to be made to popularise it, especially in rural areas, and open way more number of outlets for vaccinating.

Epidemiologist Lalit Kant, a former Head of Indian council of Medical Research’s (ICMR) Division of Epidemiology and Communicable Diseases agrees. India’s immunization programme is geared primarily to provide childhood vaccinations, he says. “The only adulthood vaccine we gave was tetanus toxoid to pregnant women.”

Thus far, at over 3 million a day India’s vaccination numbers have been impressive, says immunologist Satyajit Rath, a visiting faculty at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Pune. In terms of number of doses administered (as on 25 April 2021), India ranks third in the world with about 139.2 million doses, behind US (228.6 million doses) and China (224.9 million doses).

But this bright picture seems to dim when we see doses administered per capita,” Kant says. India’s per capita vaccination is close to 5% compared to 60% in Israel, 46% in UK and 32% in US. “Our large population dilutes the effort,” he says. The current rate of vaccination is too slow to have a meaningful impact in the near future, he says adding that the private sector healthcare infrastructure must get involved in a big way to make a dent.

Being the vaccine manufacturing hub of the world, India has the ability to beef up production for domestic use as compared to many other developed countries, he says.

Dealing with vaccine hesitancy

Vaccine hesitancy among people is often due to mixed messaging and lack of transparency in vaccine approvals or reporting of adverse events, says virologist Shahid Jameel from Ashoka University. Better communication and transparency often helps people believe in the effectiveness of vaccines, he feels.

Kang says tailor-made messages that inform and address the fundamental apprehensions about vaccines could be the key. “With credible information that counters the widespread misinformation, we need to do a lot more to convince people about the advantages of getting vaccinated,” she says.

Rath says community-based sustained engagement providing contextual and nuanced information, is particularly needed in social media platforms, which are “major present day circuits of gossip and rumour amplification.”

Vaccine diplomacy vs domestic needs

Despite meeting 60% of the world vaccine demands, India is struggling to meet domestic needs during one of the worst escalations of the outbreak across the world. Public sentiment is divided around the country’s vaccine diplomacy efforts to supply doses to other needy countries in this hour of crisis.

“We could take the point of view that the vulnerable everywhere, not just in India, are in equal need of vaccines,” Menon says. “More broadly, infectious diseases are the world's problem, not just a problem of individual countries.”

The World Health Organsation recently recognised India’s vaccine altruism as a facilitator of equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines. Though, how long India can shoulder the financial burden of providing free vaccine doses to neighbouring countries is still a question.

Rath sees vaccine diplomacy as an unethical power game in the present scenario. “The global North insists on 'intellectual property rights', opposes waivers (although some small changes are emerging in that stance), and hoards vaccine doses,” he argues. The tug of war around vaccine diplomacy has also hampered the WHO’s Covax initiative, an equitable and ethical approach to global vaccination, he says.",India,https://www.nature.com/articles/nindia.2021.63
4/8/2021,Tokyo wraps up 2020 Olympics in subdued closing ceremony,"Tokyo doused its Olympic flame on Sunday in a ceremony that echoed the restraint of the games held without spectators and transformed by the global pandemic, dazzling sport and deeply personal turmoil. After postponing the Tokyo 2020 Games for a year, organisers said the event would serve as a symbol of world triumph over the pandemic. But with strict pandemic countermeasures and as COVID-19 variants have surged back around the world, the Olympics fell short of the triumph and financial windfall Japan had wanted.

The ceremony, although lustreless, gave athletes something of a glimpse of everyday Tokyo life as the Olympic Stadium was transformed into a park with grass, buskers and BMX riders.

The scene was meant so the visitors could “experience Tokyo”, organisers said, a poignant reminder of the many restrictions of the games.

It was a duly odd ending to an unprecedented event. Japan is now saddled with a $15bn bill, double what it initially expected, and with no tourist boom.

The president of the International Olympic Committee thanked the Japanese people and acknowledged the difficulty of staging the games during the pandemic.

“For the first time since the pandemic began, the entire world came together,” Thomas Bach said. “Nobody has ever organised a postponed games before.”

Public anger over the pandemic response and a slow-to-start vaccine rollout have badly damaged Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga’s standing. Public opinion polls showed most Japanese opposed holding the games during the pandemic. Still, organisers appear to have prevented the Tokyo Games from spiralling into a COVID-19 super-spreader event, notable given that some 50,000 people came together amid the pandemic.In a sign of the measures, winners accepted their prizes from trays, putting the medals around their own necks, although social-distancing protocols such as preventing hugging were largely ignored throughout the games.While the bubble – the set of venues and hotels to which Olympic visitors were largely confined – appeared to hold, elsewhere some things fell apart. Fuelled by the Delta variant of the virus, daily infections spiked to more than 5,000 for the first time in Tokyo, threatening to overwhelm its hospitals.

Japan’s record medal haul also helped to take out some of the stings for organisers. The United States finished top of the tally with 39 gold medals, one more than rivals China at 38 and Japan at 27.

The games also showcased the Olympics’ push for more diversity.

For the first time, a victory ceremony was held for both the women’s and men’s marathon events. The Kenyan anthem filled the 68,000-capacity stadium twice, for gold medallists Peres Jepchirchir and Eliud Kipchoge. And when they came, the games themselves provided plenty of high drama.

In a moment more reminiscent of the Cold War, Belarusian sprinter Krystsina Tsimanouskaya refused to board a flight home after she was taken to the airport against her wishes. She has since sought refugee status in Poland.

US superstar gymnast Simone Biles shocked the world when she pulled out of five of her six events, including abruptly abandoning the women’s team final after attempting just one vault, citing concerns for her mental and physical health.

Her frank admission, combined with earlier comments by Japanese tennis star Naomi Osaka, brought a sharp focus on issues of athletes’ mental health.

In athletics, Italy provided a different kind of shock with their amazing run. Their wins included a stunning gold in the men’s sprint relay, taking their athletics gold tally to five.

In swimming, a US team without 23-time Olympic gold medallist Michael Phelps still ended the meeting on top of the medals table.

Capping five years of intense preparations for athletes, some of them stretched out on the grass laid down in the stadium. Some appeared to relax as they watched a volley of fireworks light up the Tokyo sky. For the first time ever, the closing ceremony featured live celebrations from the next host city as the people of Paris welcomed the handover of the Olympic flag.

In a pre-recorded video, French astronaut Thomas Pesquet performed the French national anthem on his saxophone – in zero gravity – from the International Space Station as a symbol of the Olympics’ universality, and jets released blue, white and red smoke – the colours of the French flag – over the skies of the capital.

French President Emmanuel Macron was filmed on the top floor of the Eiffel Tower reciting the newly updated Olympic slogan “higher, faster, stronger, together”.

The evening concluded at the Olympic Stadium in Tokyo with a final flurry of fireworks and the word “Arigato” – Japanese word for thank you – lighting up the night sky.",Japan,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/8/8/tokyo-wraps-up-2020-olympics-in-subdued-closing-ceremony
8/1/2021,DOD details National Guard response to Capitol attack,"WASHINGTON – Once the reality of the assault on the U.S. Capitol became apparent, National Guard troops responded appropriately and with alacrity, Department of Defense officials said in a phone briefing on Jan. 7.

""Yesterday was a horrible and shameful day here in the capital, and the nation at large,"" Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy said on the call. ""The District of Columbia asked the Army for help, and our National Guard responded.""

McCarthy, Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Rath Hoffman and Kenneth P. Rapuano, the assistant secretary of defense for homeland defense, put the timeline of the National Guard response in perspective during the call.

District of Columbia officials knew of the planned protests and had requested some assistance when the ""First Amendment demonstrations"" were planned for Jan. 5 and 6, McCarthy said. Based on this request, officials called up 340 National Guardsmen to help. The Guardsmen were assigned mainly to traffic control, Metro crowd control, some logistics support and a 40-member quick reaction force to be based at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland.

""No other requests were made,"" the Army secretary said.

But the protests turned into a mob rioting through the halls, chambers and offices of the U.S. Capitol. At around 2 p.m., D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser requested more assistance. Acting Defense Secretary Chris Miller immediately called up 1,100 members of the D.C. National Guard.

At the same time, officials were collecting Guardsmen at traffic points and Metro stations and returning them to the D.C. Armory to refit for a crowd control mission, the secretary said. Their mission was to support D.C. Metropolitan Police and Capitol Hill Police.

Guardsmen started flowing into the area of the Capitol soon after and reinforced Metro Police on the perimeter of the Capitol. This allowed the police and FBI to clear the chambers and offices of the U.S. Capitol, McCarthy said. ""By 7:15, both chambers and leadership offices were cleared, and members were able to return to business, and we began the planning for the following day,"" he said.

At 6 p.m., Miller authorized the mobilization of up to 6,200 National Guard members from Maryland, Virginia, New York, New Jersey, Delaware and Pennsylvania. These service members will flow into the city over the next few days and will help secure the peaceful transfer of power to President-elect Joseph Biden on Jan. 20.

""Yesterday's violence at the Capitol was reprehensible and contrary to the tenets of the United States Constitution,"" Miller said in a written release from the Pentagon. ""In the midst of this tragedy, I was proud of the professionalism of our Department of Defense personnel. I want to specifically recognize the service of the District of Columbia National Guard. They performed with honor, integrity and alacrity to protect people and property from unlawful acts.""

The DOD is supporting the Justice Department, which is the lead federal agency in this situation. They relied on estimates of the Metropolitan Police and Capitol Hill Police. Those organizations, which had experience with pro-Trump groups in November and December, believed the request they made for personnel was adequate.

""We don't do domestic [intelligence] collection,"" Hoffman said. ""We rely on Capitol Police and federal law enforcement to provide an assessment of the situation. And based on that assessment that they had, they believed they had sufficient personnel and did not make a request.""

Estimates of the crowd size were all over the map, Rapuano said.

Thursday, there were 741 National Guardsmen on the Capitol grounds. Guardsmen are also staffing traffic checkpoints and put up a non-scalable fence around the Capitol grounds. More Guardsmen will arrive in the days ahead.

""Our republic may have been disrupted yesterday, but the resolve of our legislators to conduct the people's business did not waver,"" Miller wrote. ""Due to their efforts, supported by local and federal law enforcement and the National Guard, the attempts of those who tried to stop our government from functioning failed. I strongly condemn these acts of violence against our democracy. I, and the people I lead in the Department of Defense, continue to perform our duties in accordance with our oath of office, and will execute the time-honored peaceful transition of power to President-elect Biden on January 20.""",USA,https://www.nationalguard.mil/News/Article/2466077/dod-details-national-guard-response-to-capitol-attack/
4/3/2021,Suez canal blockage: last of the stranded ships pass through waterway,"The last ships stranded by the grounding of a giant container vessel in the Suez canal passed through the waterway on Saturday, according to the Suez Canal Authority (SCA).

More than 400 vessels were stranded in the Mediterranean and the Red Sea when the giant container ship Ever Given became wedged across the vital waterway on 23 March. The ship was freed on Monday.Osama Rabie, the chairman of the SCA, said 85 ships were expected to pass through the canal from both sides on Saturday. They included the last 61 of the 422 ships that were queuing when the container vessel was dislodged, thus ending the backlog of shipping that built up during the crisis.

International supply chains were thrown into disarray when the 400-metre (430-yard) Ever Given ran aground . Specialist rescue teams took almost a week to free it after extensive dredging and repeated tugging operations . An SCA investigation began on Wednesday into what caused the vessel to run aground, Rabie told MBC Masr television on Friday.

“The investigation is going well and will take two more days, then we will announce the results,” he said. Now is not the time to look away

3/29/2021,"How the Giant Boat Blocking the Suez Canal Was Freed: Dredgers, Tugboats, and a Full Moon","SUEZ, Egypt — The giant container ship that blocked traffic in the Suez Canal for the last week resumed its journey on Monday after being successfully refloated.

""The efforts to float the delinquent Panamanian container ship Ever Given are successful,"" Lt. Gen. Osama Rabie, chairman of the Suez Canal Authority, said in a statement.

An NBC News eyewitness and satellite data from MarineTraffic.com, a shipping monitor site, confirmed that the ship was moving away from the shoreline toward the center of the canal.

The salvage firm hired to extract the ship also confirmed the successful operation, proclaiming “We pulled it off!”

Traffic through the crucial waterway resumed Monday evening after days of intense salvage efforts to free the ship.

""The first ship of the northern convoy crossed the Suez Canal at Port Said,"" the Suez Canal Authority said in a statement.

""Navigation will return naturally in the Suez Canal in both directions Monday evening,"" it added.

The Ever Given had brought the key global trade route to a standstill and captured the world’s attention after becoming stranded last Tuesday.

The 1,400-foot-long cargo ship jammed diagonally across a southern section of the Suez Canal, leaving a total of 367 ships, including dozens of container ships and bulk carriers, unable to use the key trading route as of Monday morning.

Dredgers worked over the weekend to dislodge the stranded vessel, shifting huge quantities of sand in an effort to help free the stranded ship, the canal authority said.

More than a dozen tugboats were used to conduct pulling maneuvers from three directions to dislodge the ship, it added.

The vessel was partially refloated after some some initial success early Monday. Efforts to free the ship then resumed when high tide brought the water level back up.

Video and images taken by NBC News reporters near the site showed the ship had moved away from its lodged position and was sailing toward the Great Bitter Lake, a wide stretch of water halfway between the north and south end of the canal where it will undergo inspection for any technical issues.

Blaring horns from neighboring vessels marked the breakthrough.


""I am excited to announce that our team of experts, working in close collaboration with the Suez Canal Authority, successfully refloated the Ever Given on 29 March at 15:05 hrs local time, thereby making free passage through the Suez Canal possible again,"" said Peter Berdowski, the CEO of salvage firm Boskalis.

Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi had earlier lauded his country's efforts.

""Today the Egyptians succeeded in ending the crisis of the grounded ship in the Suez Canal, despite massive technical complications which engulfed this operation,"" he said in a tweet on Monday. ""I thank every honest Egyptian who took part technically or practically to end this crisis.""

Brian Deese, White House Director of the National Economic Council, said there was ""tentative"" but good news out of the Suez.

""Just another reminder of how imperative it is to ensure the resilience of our supply chains going forward,"" he said on Twitter.

Evergreen Marine Corp., a major Taiwan-based shipping company that operates the ship, confirmed in a statement that the Ever Given would be repositioned to the Great Bitter Lake for an inspection of its seaworthiness.

The outcome of that inspection will determine whether the ship can resume its scheduled service, the statement added.

The stranded ship had halted all traffic across the canal, with experts initially fearing it could take weeks to free it and clear the blockage of a route that accounts for about 12 percent of global trade.

The canal usually allows 50 cargo ships to pass daily between the Mediterranean and the Red Sea, providing a vital trade corridor between Europe and Asia.

The closing threatened to disrupt oil and gas shipments to Europe from the Middle East. Already, Syria had begun rationing the distribution of fuel in the war-torn country because of concerns about delays of shipments arriving, The Associated Press reported.

Shipping rates for oil product tankers nearly doubled after the ship became stranded, Reuters reported, and the blockage had disrupted global supply chains, already strained by Covid-19 restrictions.

If the blockage dragged on, shippers may have been forced to reroute their cargoes around the Cape of Good Hope at the southern tip of Africa, adding about two weeks and extra fuel costs to journeys.",Global,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/suez-canal-ship-ever-given-partially-refloated-after-huge-effort-n1262299

8/25/2021,Afghanistan's economy in crisis after Taliban take-over,"The Taliban are in control of Afghanistan for the first time in 20 years. But while they no longer have any military opposition, they now face an economy on the brink of collapse, which threatens to worsen an already devastating humanitarian crisis.
When the militant group seized power on 15 August, Afghanistan's internal banking system froze up. Long queues have formed outside banks, many of which are closed, and ATMs that aren't dispensing money. With limited access to cash, people are becoming increasingly desperate.
The economy was already extremely fragile, heavily dependent on aid. A nation is considered aid-dependent when 10% or more of its gross domestic product (GDP) comes from foreign aid; in Afghanistan's case, about 40% of its GDP was international aid, according to the World Bank.
When it became clear that the Taliban would gain control of Kabul, western powers, including the US and Germany, suspended foreign aid to the country. The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) have also since halted payments.
Foreign reserves of Da Afghanistan Bank (DAB), the central bank, have also been frozen. DAB has reserves of roughly $9bn (£6.5bn), most of which is held in the US.
Ajmal Ahmady, the former governor of DAB, tweeted last week that he fled the country on a US military plane on the day the Taliban seized Kabul.
He said most of the DAB's reserves are held in safe, liquid assets such as US Treasury bonds and gold offshore, as per international standards.
""We can say the accessible funds to the Taliban are perhaps 0.1-0.2% of Afghanistan's total international reserves,"" he added. ""Not much.""
And last week, a Biden administration official confirmed to the BBC: ""Any central bank assets the Afghan government have in the United States will not be made available to the Taliban.""
While the economy is at a standstill, the country is facing an exodus of people, with crowds rushing to the airport to try and escape Taliban rule. One money changer in Kabul told the Wall Street Journal that some landlords are even asking their tenants to stay in their properties for free, ""because they fear that the Taliban may just take a house if it's empty"".
In a recent article in the Financial Times, Mr Ahmady wrote that claims the Taliban could get sufficient revenue from illegal mining, opium production or trade routes were ""over-optimistic"".
""Taliban revenues from such sources could be considered relatively large when only running an insurgency campaign,"" he said. ""They are wholly inadequate to operate a functional government.""
On top of foreign aid, another 4% of Afghanistan's GDP was made up of remittances, according to the World Bank - that is, family members living outside the country sending money home from abroad. This meant that it was one of the countries most dependent on remittances in the world.

Western Union and MoneyGram also stopped transferring money to Afghanistan
But in response to the Taliban's take-over and western countries halting foreign aid shipments, international transfer companies Western Union and MoneyGram suspended their services in Afghanistan - effectively cutting off the supply of family money from abroad, too.
Announcing its decision last week, Western Union said in a statement that it knew the suspension would have a huge impact on Afghans.
""We recognise that our services provide a vital channel for our customers to support their loved ones, and we will continue to closely monitor this rapidly developing situation and keep our customers and associates apprised of any developments,"" it said.
As a result, there is no hard currency for civilians to access - the banks are almost all closed, and people are unable to withdraw dollars.
Because of the volatile political situation the local currency, the afghani - which was already low in value - is now worth even less.
People have been sharing their experiences anonymously on the @HearAfghanWomen Twitter account.
In one tweet, a woman writes: ""Gas is too expensive, all banks closed, other foodstuff shortage in Kabul stores, can't find mobile top-up - and also afraid for our lives.""
In another, the account says people have resorted to selling their household belongings on the street.

9/9/2021,Afghanistan Crisis LIVE Updates: Taliban Claim Total Control Over Afghanistan,"Afghanistan Crisis Live Updates: Following their lightning-fast victory in mid-August over the former Afghan government's security forces and the withdrawal of US troops after 20 years of war, the Taliban had turned to fight the forces defending the mountainous Panjshir Valley. .
The Taliban on Monday claimed total control over Afghanistan as they said they had won the key battle for the Panjshir Valley, the last remaining holdout of resistance against their rule.

Following their lightning-fast victory in mid-August over the former Afghan government's security forces and the withdrawal of US troops after 20 years of war, the Taliban had turned to fight the forces defending the mountainous Panjshir Valley.

As the Islamist hardliners claimed victory, their chief spokesman warned against any further attempts to rise up against their rule, while he also urged former members of the security forces to join their regime's ranks.

""With this victory, our country is completely taken out of the quagmire of war,"" chief spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said in a press conference in Kabul.

""The Islamic Emirate is very sensitive about insurgencies. Anyone who tries to start an insurgency will be hit hard. We will not allow another,"" he added.",Afghanistan,https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/afghanistan-crisis-live-updates-leader-of-afghan-holdout-region-says-he-is-ready-to-talk-with-taliban-2531012

11/27/2021,Coronavirus India Highlights: Omicron now in over 20 countries; Indian states step up measures,"Coronavirus India Highlights: States in India are stepping up precautionary measures over fears of the Omicron variant of the novel coronavirus, which has now spread to around 20 countries. In Delhi, for example, passengers landing from ‘at risk’ countries now have to get tested at the airport and can leave only once they get their results. The Maharashtra government has made institutional quarantine mandatory for travellers arriving from ‘at risk’ countries. Union Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya Tuesday informed Parliament that India had so far not reported any case of the new variant, and underlined that the government was taking measures to ensure it does not reach the country.
Meanwhile, it has been revealed that Omicron was in circulation in countries before it was detected and announced by scientists in South Africa. The World Health Organization has warned that blanket travel bans will not prevent the international spread of Omicron, but place a heavy burden on lives and livelihoods.",India,https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/afghanistan-crisis-live-updates-leader-of-afghan-holdout-region-says-he-is-ready-to-talk-with-taliban-2531014
11/27/2021,"New Covid Strain Named Omicron, Classified As ""Variant Of Concern"" By WHO","Geneva:
The World Health Organization on Friday declared the recently-discovered B.1.1.529 strain of Covid-19, first detected in southern Africa, to be a variant of concern and renamed it Omicron.

The classification puts Omicron into the most-troubling category of Covid-19 variants, along with the globally-dominant Delta, plus its weaker rivals Alpha, Beta and Gamma.

Nations rushed to ban flights to slow the spread of Omicron on Friday, while stock markets and oil prices plunged on fears surrounding the variant, potentially dealing a heavy blow to the global economic recovery.

""Based on the evidence presented indicative of a detrimental change in Covid-19 epidemiology... the WHO has designated B.1.1.529 as a variant of concern (VOC), named Omicron,"" the UN health agency said in a statement.

The WHO said it could take several weeks to complete studies of Omicron to see if there are any changes in transmissibility, severity or implications for Covid vaccines, tests and treatments.


Reinfection Concerns

The change in classification came after a quickly-assembled virtual meeting of the WHO's Technical Advisory Group on SARS-CoV-2 Virus Evolution.

The variant was first reported to the WHO from South Africa on Wednesday.

The first known confirmed Omicron infection was from a specimen collected on November 9. In recent weeks, infections in South Africa have increased steeply, coinciding with the detection.

""This variant has a large number of mutations, some of which are concerning,"" the WHO said, pointing to worrying characteristics.

""Preliminary evidence suggests an increased risk of reinfection with this variant, as compared to other VOCs.""

It said the number of Omicron cases appeared to be increasing in almost all provinces of South Africa.

As for testing for the strain, the WHO added: ""Current SARS-CoV-2 PCR diagnostics continue to detect this variant.""

Greek Alphabet Names

All viruses mutate over time, including SARS-CoV-2, the virus which causes Covid-19 disease.

During late 2020, the emergence of variants that posed an increased risk to global public health prompted the WHO to start characterising them as variants of interest, and the more-worrying variants of concern, to inform the response to the pandemic.

The UN health agency decided to name the variants after the letters of the Greek alphabet, to avoid the countries that first detected them being stigmatised.

The WHO on Friday called on countries to increase their surveillance and virus sequencing efforts to better understand circulating variants.

Maria Van Kerkhove, the WHO's technical lead on Covid-19, urged people to reduce their chances of catching the virus.

""We understand that people are concerned,"" she said.

""What's really important as an individual is to lower your exposure.

""These proven public health measures, have never been more important,"" she said, citing distancing, mask-wearing, avoiding crowded spaces, good ventilation, ""and when it's your turn, get vaccinated"".

Travel Concerns

Apart from South Africa, Omicron has been detected in Israel in a person coming from Malawi; Botswana; Belgium and Hong Kong.

Despite countries scrambling to ban flights, the WHO earlier cautioned against imposing travel restrictions due to Omicron.

The organisation said countries should take a risk-based and scientific approach when considering travel curbs in light of the variant -- but cautioned against restrictions.

""At this point, again, implementing travel measures is being cautioned against,"" spokesman Christian Lindmeier told reporters.

Besides Delta, Omicron and the three other VOCs, there are currently two lower variants of interest and below that, a further seven under monitoring.

Delta, which is more transmissible than the original strain, is now overwhelmingly dominant around the world, having all but out-competed other variants.

Of 845,000 sequences uploaded to the GISAID global science initiative with specimens collected in the last 60 days, 99.8 percent were Delta.",Geneva,https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/afghanistan-crisis-live-updates-leader-of-afghan-holdout-region-says-he-is-ready-to-talk-with-taliban-2531015
