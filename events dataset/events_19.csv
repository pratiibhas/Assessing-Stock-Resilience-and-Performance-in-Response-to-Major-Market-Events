The margins of victory
Narendra Modi and his ruling BJP have swept back to power. The party won 303 seats in the Lok Sabha, the lower house of India's parliament, bettering the 282 seats they won in 2014 - a performance that not many thought was possible. 2014 India results map
A party needs to win 272 seats for a majority in parliament. The BJP's victory in 2014 was the first time in three decades that a party had been able to win that number of seats on its own.
Rahul Gandhi's opposition Indian National Congress (INC) and its allies, who only won 54 seats the last time, put up a stronger fight this time but were unable to make any meaningful gains.
Women voters made their voices heard
Nearly half of India's 900 million registered voters are women.
Since independence, female voters have increasingly turned out to vote in greater numbers.But 2019 marked the first time that female voter turnout equalled male voter turnout.

6-Aug-19,Article 370: What happened with Kashmir and why it matters,"India's BJP-led government is hailing its decision to strip the state of Jammu and Kashmir of autonomy after seven decades, characterising it as the correction of a ""historical blunder"". The BBC's Geeta Pandey in Delhi explains why this has happened and why it's important.
Why is Kashmir controversial?
Kashmir is a Himalayan region that both India and Pakistan say is fully theirs.
The area was once a princely state called Jammu and Kashmir, but it joined India in 1947 soon after the sub-continent was divided up at the end of British rule.
India and Pakistan subsequently went to war over it and each came to control different parts of the territory with a ceasefire line agreed.
There has been violence in the Indian-administered side - the state of Jammu and Kashmir - for 30 years due to a separatist insurgency against Indian rule.
What's happened now?
In the first few days of August, there were signs of something afoot in Kashmir.
Tens of thousands of additional Indian troops were deployed, a major Hindu pilgrimage was cancelled, schools and colleges were shut, tourists were ordered to leave, telephone and internet services were suspended and regional political leaders were placed under house arrest.
But most of the speculation was that Article 35A of the Indian constitution, which gave some special privileges to the people of the state, would be scrapped.
The government then stunned everyone by saying it was revoking nearly all of Article 370, which 35A is part of and which has been the basis of Kashmir's complex relationship with India for some 70 years.
Presentational white space
How significant is Article 370?
The article allowed the state a certain amount of autonomy - its own constitution, a separate flag and freedom to make laws. Foreign affairs, defence and communications remained the preserve of the central government.
As a result, Jammu and Kashmir could make its own rules relating to permanent residency, ownership of property and fundamental rights. It could also bar Indians from outside the state from purchasing property or settling there.
Modi's Kashmir move will fuel resentment
Former chief minister says India has betrayed Kashmir
Why a special law on Kashmir is controversial
The constitutional provision has underpinned India's often fraught relationship with Kashmir, the only Muslim-majority region to join India at partition. Why did the government do it?
Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party had long opposed Article 370 and revoking it was in the party's 2019 election manifesto.
They argued it needed to be scrapped to integrate Kashmir and put it on the same footing as the rest of India. After returning to power with a massive mandate in the April-May general elections, the government lost no time in acting on its pledge.
Critics of Monday's move are linking it to the economic slowdown that India is currently facing - they say it provides a much-needed diversion for the government.

India has had a fraught relationship with Kashmir for decades
Many Kashmiris believe that the BJP ultimately wants to change the demographic character of the Muslim-majority region by allowing non-Kashmiris to buy land there.
Although Home Minister Amit Shah's announcement in parliament on Monday came as a surprise to most Indians, it would have taken the government some preparation to arrive at the decision.
The move also fits in with Mr Modi's desire to show that the BJP is tough on Kashmir, and Pakistan.
What's changed on the ground?
Kashmir will no longer have a separate constitution but will have to abide by the Indian constitution much like any other state.
All Indian laws will be automatically applicable to Kashmiris, and people from outside the state will be able to buy property there.
The government says this will bring development to the region.

Hindu rightwing groups have welcomed the move
""I want to tell the people of Jammu and Kashmir what damage Articles 370 and 35A did to the state,"" Mr Shah told parliament. ""It's because of these sections that democracy was never fully implemented, corruption increased in the state, that no development could take place.""
The government is also moving to break up the state into two smaller, federally administered territories. One region will combine Muslim-majority Kashmir and Hindu-majority Jammu. The other is Buddhist-majority Ladakh, which is culturally and historically close to Tibet.
P Chidambaram, a senior leader in the opposition Congress Party described the decision as a ""catastrophic step"" and warned in parliament that it could have serious consequences.
""You may think you have scored a victory, but you are wrong and history will prove you to be wrong. Future generations will realise what a grave mistake this house is making today,"" he said.

Why did 2018 see more violence in Indian-administered Kashmir?
Is this all legal?
According to the constitution, Article 370 could only be modified with the agreement of the ""state government"". But there hasn't been much of a state government in Jammu and Kashmir for over a year now.
In June last year, India imposed federal rule after the government of the then chief minister, Mehbooba Mufti, was reduced to a minority. This meant the federal government only had to seek the consent of the governor who imposes its rule.
The government says it is well within its rights to bring in the changes and that similar decisions have been taken by federal governments in the past.
But expert opinion is sharply divided.
One constitutional expert, Subhash Kashyap, told news agency ANI that the order was ""constitutionally sound"" and that ""no legal and constitutional fault can be found in it"".
However another constitutional expert, AG Noorani, told BBC Hindi it was ""an illegal decision, akin to committing fraud"" that could be challenged in the Supreme Court.
Opposition political parties could launch a legal challenge but Kashmir is an emotive issue with many Indians, and most parties would be wary of opposing the move lest they be branded anti-India.
That could leave any challenge up to individuals or activists.",Not Found,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-49234708,india
Not Found,India revokes Kashmir’s special status,"The Indian government revoked the special status accorded to Indian-administered Kashmir in its constitution, the most far-reaching political move on the disputed region in nearly 70 years. A presidential decree issued on August 5 revoked Article 370 of India’s constitution that guaranteed special rights to the Muslim-majority state, including the right to its own constitution and autonomy to make laws on all matters except defence, communications and foreign affairs.

In the lead-up to the move, India sent thousands of additional troops to the disputed region, imposed a crippling curfew, shut down telecommunications and internet, and arrested political leaders.

The move has worsened the already-heightened tensions with neighbouring Pakistan, which said it would downgrade its diplomatic relations with India.

India and Pakistan claim Kashmir in full but rule it in part. The nuclear-armed neighbours have fought two of their three wars over the disputed territory. A rebellion in Indian-administered Kashmir has been ongoing for three decades.

’20 protests a day’ in Kashmir despite lockdown
Kashmir has seen an average of nearly 20 protests a day against Indian rule over the last six weeks despite a security lockdown to quell unrest, a senior government source told AFP news agency.

Altogether there have been 722 protests since August 5, with the main city of Srinagar, Baramulla district in the northwest and Pulwama in the south being the biggest hotspots, the source said. Nearly 200 civilians and 415 security forces have been wounded, according to the source.So far, more than 4,100 people – including 170 political leaders – have been detained across the valley, with 3,000 released in the past two weeks, the official said.Pakistan says India fire kills soldier, woman in Kashmir
India and Pakistan have traded fire along their highly militarised frontier in the disputed Kashmir region, Pakistani officials said, leaving a Pakistani soldier and a woman killed. The two nations regularly exchange fire along the so-called Line of Control, which splits Kashmir between them.

Pakistani local administrator Raja Tariq said shelling hit villages in the Nakyal area, killing the woman and wounding six others. Police and local officials said Indian fire in other sectors of Pakistan-administered Kashmir also destroyed a house, partly damaged a school, and hit a shed for cows and goats resulting in the animals’ deaths. Pakistan’s military also said Indian troops opened fire “unprovoked” in the Hajipir sector, killing a soldier.Friday, September 13

Khan said he would raise the issue at the UN General Assembly and “every international platform”.

Gates Foundation criticised over award to India’s Modi
A decision by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to honour Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his campaign to improve sanitation in India has come under fire from activists and members of the civil society, who have urged the philanthropic body to withdraw the award.

The award comes in recognition of the Hindu nationalist leader’s Swachh Bharat Abhiyan (Clean India Mission) programme under which millions of toilets have been built. But activists say hygiene and cleanliness cannot compensate for rights abuses against the minorities in Kashmir and other parts of India.

Thousands arrested in Kashmir crackdown: Official data
Authorities in Indian-administered Kashmir have arrested nearly 4,000 people since the scrapping of its special status last month, government data shows, the most clear evidence yet of the scale of one of the disputed region’s biggest crackdowns.

A government report dated September 6 and seen by the Reuters news agency, said more than 3,800 people were arrested, though about 2,600 have since been released.

It was not clear on what basis most of the people were being held, but an Indian official said some were held under the Public Safety Act, a law in Jammu and Kashmir state that allows for detention for up to two years without charge.

9-Nov-19,Ayodhya verdict: Indian top court gives holy site to Hindus,"The disputed holy site of Ayodhya in northern India should be given to Hindus who want a temple built there, the country's Supreme Court has ruled.
The case, which has been bitterly contested for decades by Hindus and Muslims, centres on the ownership of the land in Uttar Pradesh state.
Muslims would get another plot of land to construct a mosque, the court said.
Many Hindus believe the site is the birthplace of one of their most revered deities, Lord Ram.
Muslims say they have worshipped there for generations.At the centre of the row is the 16th Century Babri mosque which was demolished by Hindu mobs in 1992, sparking riots that killed nearly 2,000 people.
What did the court say?
In the unanimous verdict, the court said that a report by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) provided evidence that the remains of a building ""that was not Islamic"" was beneath the structure of the demolished Babri mosque.
The court said that, given all the evidence presented, it had determined that the disputed land should be given to Hindus for a temple to Lord Ram, while Muslims would be given land elsewhere to construct a mosque.
It then directed the federal government to set up a trust to manage and oversee the construction of the temple.However, the court added that the demolition of the Babri mosque was against the rule of law.
What has the reaction to the verdict been?
Despite warnings by authorities not to celebrate the verdict, BBC correspondents in court say they heard chants of ""Jai Shree Ram"" (Hail Lord Ram) outside as the judgement was pronounced.
""It's a very balanced judgement and it is a victory for people of India,"" a lawyer for one of the Hindu parties told reporters soon after.
Initially, a representative for the Muslim litigants said they were not satisfied and would decide whether to ask for a review after they had read the whole judgement.
However, the main group of litigants has now said that it will not appeal against the verdict.
Outside the court, the situation has been largely calm.
Hundreds of people were detained in Ayodhya on Friday ahead of the verdict, amid fears of violence.
Thousands of police officers have also been deployed in the city, while shops and colleges have been shut until Monday.
The government issued an order banning the publication of images of the destruction of the Babri mosque.
Social media platforms are being monitored for inflammatory content, with police even replying to tweets and asking users to delete them.Prime Minister Narendra Modi reacted to the verdict on Twitter and said that it should not be seen as a ""win or loss for anybody"".
What was arguably one of the world's most contentious property dispute has finally come to an end.
The dispute over the plot has polarised, frustrated and exhausted India.
The reason is that this is not a humdrum civil matter. It was touched by faith (Hindus believe the plot was the birthplace of Lord Ram, a revered deity) violence (the demolition of the mosque in 1992) and subterfuge (idols of Lord Ram were placed in the mosque surreptitiously in 1949).
Saturday's unanimous judgement by the five most senior judges of the court will hopefully lead to some reconciliation that the country badly needs.
The verdict showed ""judicial craftsmanship and statesmanship where the letter of the law was adhered to, but the relief was moulded, taking into account the ground realities,"" lawyer Sanjay Hegde told me. The judges appear to have gone by the evidence laid before it. ""They have applied a plaster. Let's not reopen the wounds,"" Mr Hegde added.Will the verdict lead to a closure of past animosities and help close India's deepening religious fissures? Only time will tell.
For the moment, India's main communities need to avoid triumphalism - because eventually there are no victors and vanquished, in what is essentially a contestation of faith.
line
What is the row actually about?
Many Hindus believe the Babri Masjid was actually constructed on the ruins of a Hindu temple that was demolished by Muslim invaders in the 16th Century.
Muslims say they offered prayers at the mosque until December 1949 when some Hindus placed an idol of Ram in the mosque and began to worship the idols. The two religious groups have gone to court many times over who should control the site.
Since then, there have been calls to build a temple on the spot where the mosque once stood.
Hinduism is India's majority religion and is thought to be more than 4,000 years old. India's first Islamic dynasty was established in the early 13th Century.
Have religious tensions eased in India in recent years?
Ever since the Narendra Modi-led Hindu nationalist BJP first came to power in 2014, India has seen deepening social and religious divisions.
The call for the construction of a Hindu temple in Ayodhya has grown particularly loud, and has mostly come from MPs, ministers and leaders from the BJP since it took office.Restrictions on the sale and slaughter of cows - considered a holy animal by the majority Hindus - have led to vigilante killings of a number of people, most of them Muslims who were transporting cattle.
An uninhibited display of muscular Hindu nationalism in other areas has also contributed to religious tension.

1/5/2019,Kashmir attack: Tracing the path that led to Pulwama,"The suicide attack that killed more than 40 Indian soldiers in February was carried out by a young Kashmiri from Pulwama. Ahead of voting in the region in India's general election, Sameer Yasir reports on the rise in youth militancy over the past two years.
Around 15:15 local time (09:45 GMT) on 14 February, Adil Ahmad Dar drove a vehicle packed with explosives into a convoy of 78 buses carrying Indian paramilitary police in Pulwama, on the heavily guarded Srinagar-Jammu highway.
It was a devastating attack - the worst carried out against Indian forces in decades.
It shocked the country, as newspapers and TV screens were filled with stories of soldiers and their shattered families. Some had just returned from a visit home; others had called a family member hours before the attack; a few were speaking to them on the phone when the explosives went off.
Adil Ahmad Dar was identified hours later, when the Pakistan-based militant group, Jaish-e-Mohammad, released a video online saying it had carried out the attack. In the video, Dar appears to show no remorse for what he is going to do. He said he joined the group in 2018 and was eventually ""assigned"" the task of carrying out the attack in Pulwama.
He said that by the time the video was released he would be in jannat (heaven).
As tensions between nuclear-armed India and Pakistan rose in the aftermath of the attack and Kashmir remained on edge, more details about Dar emerged. His story was disturbingly familiar.
Reuters The 14 February attack was the deadliest against Indian security forces in decadesReuters
The 14 February attack was the deadliest against Indian security forces in decades
He grew up in Indian-administered Kashmir in Pulwama district where the attack occurred. Pulwama is part of the Anantnag constituency - the only seat in the Indian election that is voting over three different phases for security reasons, the last being on 6 May.
Dar was a high school dropout and had been doing odd jobs as a mason when his parents reported him missing in March last year.
He was 22, and, by all accounts, shy and quiet. His family say his anger against the Indian state grew after he was injured while participating in a protest against the killing of a popular militant in 2016.Dar was one of thousands of Kashmiris who were born, and later died, in the shadow of the gun.
There has been an armed rebellion against Indian rule in Muslim-majority Kashmir since 1989. India blames Pakistan for fomenting violence in the region by supporting militancy - a charge Pakistan denies. Since 1989, Kashmir has been convulsed by regular episodes of violence that have killed more than 70,000 people, including many Kashmiri Hindus targeted by militants in the early 1990s.
Critics say India's heavy-handed tactics have alienated local youths. A UN report on violence in the region between June 2016 and April 2018 pointed to excessive force used by Indian security personnel, including the firing of pellet guns that have blinded hundreds. India rejected the report and its findings.
""Kashmiris who were born after the 1990s have never seen peace,"" says Abdul Ahad Bhat, 68, a resident of Pulwama. ""They were born amid curfews and died before they ended.""
Mr Bhat says the Kashmir he remembers from before 1989 is a ""dream"" this generation has been denied.
Militancy in the valley had declined by the 2000s but grew again after the killing of young militant leader, Burhan Wani, in 2016. And it has been on the rise since - 2016 saw the deaths of 150 suspected militants and more than 230 died in 2018, according to official figures.
Wani was extremely active on social media. India considered him a terrorist but for many locals he represented a new Kashmiri generation. When he was killed in a gun battle with Indian security forces, protests engulfed the valley.
Dozens were killed and hundreds injured as security forces fired live rounds and tear gas at protesters. Many were also blinded by pellets. Adil Ahmad Dar, who took part in the protests, was shot in the leg and bedridden for 11 months.
""That day changed him,"" says his father, Ghulam Hassan Dar, 62. ""A shy boy transformed into a volcano of anger but he rarely expressed it.""
He, like other locals, believes many of the boys and men who protested at Wani's killing joined the insurgency.
Adil Ahmad Dar spent more time praying and reading on the internet while recovering than mingling with his friends. He ran away from home to join the militants in March 2018.

Burhan Wani's killing in 2016 drew sympathy in the Kashmir valley
The family found out about his involvement in the attack when his uncle, Abdul Rashid Dar, received a call from police. He says he was horrified to learn that his nephew - under the alias Waqas Commando - was behind the attack.
Some in the family's village, Gundibagh, react similarly.
One said Dar had hardly talked to anyone after his cousin, Manzoor, a suspected militant, was killed in June 2016. Others speak of his frustration with the political situation in Kashmir. ""He was saddened by militants 'dying like chickens', without putting up a fight or inflicting casualties on the other side,"" said Altaf, another relative, who arrived with hundreds of villagers to attend Dar's funeral the day after the attack.
The support extended to the family is unsurprising given that many Kashmiris resent Indian security forces and accuse them of human rights violations. In the past few years, funerals of militants in south Kashmir have drawn large crowds.

Jibran Ahmad, a Pulwama resident, says: ""You become a militant in a police station or an army camp, not inside the four corners of your house.
""Many of those arrested by police in 2016 joined the militancy. Perhaps they thought it was better than being humiliated every day.""
Some of the men joining the militants recently have been highly educated and come from financially stable families. A federal minister told India's parliament in December that at least 26 of these new militants in 2018 were graduates and he referred to them as ""misguided youth"".Sushant Sareen, a senior fellow at the Observer Research Foundation, an independent think tank, says part of the problem is that violence is ""glorified"".
""In most societies there is no social sanction given to people who indulge in violence. In Kashmir, however, there is social sanction - a certain amount of 'coolness',"" he says.

He adds: ""When stone pelting is happening, should the government hunker down and do nothing? When people pick up arms, should they do nothing?""
No army ever wants to fire on unarmed civilians, he says.
One policeman based in Kashmir who wished to remain anonymous says India's approach has not worked. He said he did not want to be identified because he feared being rebuked by his superiors for speaking publicly about such a sensitive issue.
""When you kill one militant, two more are ready to join. Political outreach is important but in recent years we have focused on killing militants,"" he says.
Author and counter-terrorism expert Ajai Sahni says India's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party has demonised the valley and ""created an enemy for the entire country"" which may be a ""successful election strategy but is disastrous for national security"".
In the days after Pulwama, sporadic incidents of harassment and violence were reported against Kashmiris in some north Indian cities.

13/05/2019, Balakot air strikes: The inside story,"Hours before the Balakot strike deep in the heart of Pakistan, Prime Minister Narendra Modi gave no indication to those who met him that he had taken such a momentous decision. One that would push the two countries closest to a war since the stand-off in 2002 after the Pakistan-backed Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorists attacked Kaluchak in J&K and killed 30 people. It would be the first time that India was conducting an air strike in mainland Pakistan since 1971. It was a decision as far-reaching as overtly declaring India’s nuclear capability, like Indira Gandhi and Atal Bihari Vajpayee did with the nuclear tests in 1974 and 1998. It signalled a paradigm shift in the way India would deal with Pakistan in future when it came to terror attacks.

Modi, though, appeared as collected as ever when he returned to his official residence7, Lok Kalyan Margat 9.30 pm after a speaking engagement. The tense relations between India and Pakistan after the Pulwama attack on February 14 that saw 40 security personnel killed in a suicide bomb attack by the JeM had barely found a mention in his address. But his staff found it strange that the prime minister did not go to bed at midnight as usual. Instead, he kept working on files in his study and sending emails while monitoring the progress of the Balakot air strikes.

Around 3 am, the prime minister was informed that a fleet of Indian Air Force (IAF) fighter jets had taken off and was shortly expected to cross into Pakistani territory. Half an hour later, he was told the jets had hit their target in Pakistan and flown safely back to their respective bases. He kept getting subsequent updates on the damage the jets had caused.

He himself was surfing social media to see if there was any reaction to the mission, particularly from Pakistan. It was only when Modi called for an urgent meeting at 9.40 am to brief his Cabinet Committee on Security, which includes the finance, external affairs, home and defence ministers, that his team realised what had kept him awake all night.

In the following days, with Pakistan launching a counter strike, a thick fog of controversy surrounded the big questions: what was behind Modi’s decision to clear an air strike on mainland Pakistan? Was the target of the Indian fighter jets a working camp of the Jaish or an abandoned one as Pakistan claimed? What evidence was there to show that the Indian jets had carried out precision strikes with lethal effect rather than merely felling a few trees in the vicinity, as Pakistan mockingly said?

Was there proof to show India had shot down a Pakistani F-16 aircraft in the dogfight the day after the Balakot strike? After talking in confidence to a range of top government sources involved in the decision-making process, INDIA TODAY pieced together exclusive details that for the first time provide substantially more information on some of the key questions that have dominated public conversation since Balakot.

Crossing the rubicon

When Modi heard of the terror strike in Pulwama on February 14, aides say he was deeply anguished by the loss of our security personnel and angered by the brazenness with which the JeM and its handlers in Pakistan had conducted the brutal attack. He publicly vowed that the perpetrators of the attack would not go unpunished. Modi’s decisions, they say, are never based on emotions or on an impulse. He says that what is needed in crisis situations such as these is a high degree of clarity on what you want so that, as an aide put it, one can move from a state of being to becoming.

Modi, in his mind, was clear that the nuclear blackmail Pakistan had exploited over decades had to be nailed once and for all. In the past, it had been a major deterrent against India attacking Pakistan, thus straitjacketing our options to retaliate. It had emboldened Pakistan to continue to bleed India with a steady stream of low-cost terror strikes. In September 2016, Modi ordered a surgical strike across the Line of Control after the Uri attack in which 23 people died. The action was meant to signal that India would not shy away from punitive action, though his critics said it had been done before but not publicised.

While taking a decision to strike Pakistan, Modi seems to have followed one of Chinese general Sun Tzu’s dictums: If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained, you’ll also suffer defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle. There was no doubt India was stronger than Pakistan—it was the fastest growing economic power, it was being run by a government with a secure majority and had a leader willing to take bold if risky decisions. Also, barring China, the Modi government had the major world powers behind him.Pakistan, on the other hand, was in the grip of an economic meltdown and had a weak political leader dependent on its army. Yet both China and the US needed it—one to further the reach of its power and the other to broker a deal in Afghanistan. As important was the fact that Pakistan was a nuclear power and had to be handled with care; in the adversarial words of a highly-placed government source: an unpredictable Islamic mindset with a first-strike nuclear doctrine. Modi was clear: India would not head down the path of mutually assured destruction with Pakistan in any action taken to avenge Pulwama.

The nuclear ghost

Modi’s aides also mulled over what would constitute an audacious and imaginative strike yet would not push the countries up the nuclear escalation ladder. As one of them put it, “We can’t be foolhardy and exhibit Dutch courage. In an hour of crisis, the prime minister’s biggest strength is to ask the combination of right questions and, like a good Gujarati, do a cost-benefit analysis. He believed the cost should never be disproportionate to the objective and wanted us to always ask: where am I and where do I want to be.”Modi then laid down the objectives to his team by stating that India was not against the people of Pakistan or its government, but against the terror groups and their masters in the deep state. That India’s response should be proportionate to what Pakistan had done. Any strike by India also had to be within the range of what the international community could view as reasonable’ action.

There needed to be a measured action against non-military targets, such as training camps for terrorists. Any collateral damage to civilians and military targets was to be avoided. The idea, as an aide reveals, was not to prevent escalation but to get the escalation threshold right. India knew that using the air force would enhance the risk, but the prime minister was clear that we needed to try the unexpected.

To that extent, the prime minister gave National Security Advisor Ajit Doval and the chiefs of the armed forces a free hand to plan out a strike for a limited objective but instructed them to keep him fully informed of the alternatives. Clarifies another top aide, The PM was clear that at no stage was there to be a policy to escalate to war; there was no goal/ no target of that kind, we were not looking to annex any territory. The two nations are aware of the risks involved.

Modi told them that while they must do everything to give Pakistan a fitting reply, they needed to ensure that there were no civilian casualties, that every detail was checked and that the information they had gathered about the target was accurate. So Doval, the intelligence chiefs and the three chiefs of the armed forces got down to finding a target that was totally purified, meaning it would not entail collateral damage of any kind.

Why Balakot?

Intelligence agencies then homed in on around 15 camps run by different terror groups in Pakistan for a strike. But they decided to focus on the ones run by the Jaish because of its involvement in the Pulwama attack. Three such main camps were identified: in Bahawalpur in Pakistani Punjab, Sawai Nallah near Muzaffarabad (PoK) and Balakot in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province (KPK).

The Bahawalpur complex was difficult to strike without incurring civilian casualties because over the years it had grown into a vast sprawl with a mosque, hospitals and training camps all functioning cheek by jowl in a densely populated area of Punjab. Sawai Nallah was among the largest of the Jaish camps but it wasn’t chosen because it was in PoK. In 2016, Modi had ordered surgical strikes on Jaish camps in PoK after the Uri attacks. But with the toll in Pulwama being so high, the prime minister was keen that the target makes a much bigger statement than just another strike across the LoC.

The Jaish camp at Balakot then was the ideal choice as it was in mainland Pakistan. The Markaz Syed Ahmad Shaheed, as the camp is known, was set up in 2004-05 and is on the crest of a ridge called Jaba Top. Relatively isolated from the civilian zone, it was accessible only via a steep three-kilometre dirt road from the valley. It had been under the scrutiny of Indian intelligence agencies over the years, allowing them to build up strong hum-int (human intelligence) that gave in-depth information on the way the camp was functioning. Spread over six acres, the camp had 10 major buildings or complexes devoted to various kinds of activities. Most importantly, the camp was run by Masood Azhar’s brother-in-law Yusuf Azhar, who resided in an abandoned school complex on the campus.

After the air strike by India, Pakistan claimed that the camp had been abandoned by the Jaish years ago. Yet there was nothing barren about the Balakot camp when the IAF struck it early on the morning of February 26. INDIA TODAY was shown photographs and given details of the complex gathered by Indian intelligence agencies, and they revealed a camp teeming with life and jihadis.

Not a barren camp

Indian agencies had pictures of the trail that led to the camp from Balakot, with one billboard giving details of the camp and another asking for recruits to sign up. Photographs showed that the steps leading to the main complex had the US, UK and Israeli flags painted on them so that anyone who entered walked over them. The main complex was a large U-shaped structure with a big hall and eight rooms located on the ground floor with a dormitory type residence on the other floors.

Indian agencies had information on who was staying in each room when the strike took place. Room 1 was for chief trainer Yusuf Azhar. The other rooms had senior Jaish trainers Mufti Umar and Maulana Javed (Room 2), Maulana Aslam and Maulana Abdul Gafur Kashmiri (Room 3), Maulana Ajmal and Maulana Zubair (Room 4). Rooms 5 to 8 had six other trainers. Staying on the top floor of the complex were reportedly 97 fidayeen who were undergoing training.

A little distance away was the mosque complex. Indian agencies had pictures of the mosque with its walls lined with portraits of shaheeds or militants who had died fighting in Kashmir. Adjacent to it was a double-storeyed building with three rooms on each floor being used as a guesthouse. Three hard-core terrorist trainers—Maulana Qudratullah, Maulana Junaid and Maulana Qasim of Lahore—were staying there. All three are said to have been declared absconders under Pakistan’s Anti-Terrorism Act and had not returned to their respective homes for years. Qudratullah is regarded as a special mentor while Qasim imparted martial arts skills to the new recruits.

At the northern end of the camp was another large complex with a hostel, dining room and a big hall that housed as many 150 recruits of various categories. The agencies even had information on the number of recruits and the hierarchies they were grouped under as per the Jaish organisational structure. In all, there were around 200 recruits attending various training courses and they were divided into three groups: Daura-e-Aam (those given basic training, numbering a total of 93); Daura-e-Khas (those getting military training and totalling 81) and Daura-e-Zarar (receiving advanced weapons training and numbering 25). Billboard advertisements in Balakot town called for recruits for a fresh course that was to begin on February 25. There would be an estimated 300 people in the camp after that date. The core team headed by Doval, set up to plan the strikes, briefed the prime minister about Balakot. On February 19, Modi gave the IAF clearance to launch the strike.

The high-flying heroes

Air Chief Marshal Birender Singh (Tony) Dhanoa’s face lit up when he was informed that his force had been tasked to execute the kill. Dhanoa is a specialist in planning such strikes and was among those entrusted to work out a plan to hit Pakistan after the attack on the Jammu and Kashmir assembly in 2001. It was then that he realised that there was no coordination between Indian intelligence agencies and the armed forces over such information. The intelligence officer gave him a description of the camp and how to reach it by foot. Dhanoa remembers telling him, “What do you want me to do with it—go to a restaurant and eat lunch there? What we need are geographical coordinates that I can use to strike them from the air.”

Eighteen years later, he was delighted to notice the sea change in India’s intelligence-gathering technology. Dhanoa and his team appreciated the minute details of the Balakot complex that the agencies had collected. Backed by high-resolution satellite pictures of the camp, these details would prove invaluable to his pilots during the strike. Following the prime minister’s clearance, a team of top air force officers and intelligence agency brass was set up to meet daily and chalk out the details of the strike.

Pakistan was already on high alert, with PM Modi repeatedly stating in various public meetings that he would not let the perpetrators of the Pulwama attack go unpunished. To strike Balakot, the IAF would have to employ deception, ensure surprise and speed while hitting the chosen targets. So, as part of the plan, they increased the routine night-flying sorties in Jammu and Srinagar to avoid Pakistan detecting any unusual movement of aircraft.

Part of the timing of the strike was determined by the fact that the Bangalore air show was on from February 20 to February 24. With so many high-level international visitors, India did not want to carry out the strikes while the show was on. The other reason was that with fresh recruits coming into the Balakot camp on the 25th, the following day would be the best time to strike the camp. Senior air force officers maintained an aura of normalcy right up to the night of the strike to avoid Pakistani intelligence getting tipped off. On the evening of the 25th, Dhanoa attended a farewell dinner for the retiring Western Air Command chief Chandrashekharan Hari Kumar.

Though Hari Kumar was heading the team tasked to carry out the strike, it was decided to go ahead with his farewell party lest Pakistan think something was up if it was cancelled. It was only around 10 pm that Dhanoa got home and started monitoring the strike. It was raining in Delhi and he was worried the weather would be bad in Balakot as well. But fortunately, the skies there were clear; it was, in fact, a moonlit night. Around 3 am was chosen as the timing of the strike because everyone would be asleep in their various complexes.

The plan was simple but brilliant. The strikes would be carried out by a dozen Mirage 2000 aircraft equipped with Israeli-built SPICE (Smart Precise Impact and Cost Effective) 2000 bombs that could hit with pinpoint precision thanks to their robust guidance system that uses onboard GPS and an optical camera to navigate it to an intended target 60 km away. The Mirages were reportedly accompanied by four Sukhoi-30s to provide air cover.

Two surveillance aircraft, the Israeli Phalcon Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) and the indigenous Netra Airborne Early Warning and Control (AEW&C) system, were deployed as were two IL-76s for mid-air refuelling. To avoid alerting Pakistan air defence, these aircraft took off from the Agra and Bareilly bases. Since they had to overfly Delhi, the air force alerted traffic control to create a dark corridor of air space they could fly through undetected.

As the aircraft approached Pakistani air space, they flew in formation with one lot seemingly headed to Bahawalpur. Thinking that the IAF intended to strike the Jaish headquarters, Pakistan scrambled its fighters to take on the oncoming Indian jets. That distraction allowed the accompanying low-flying formation of Mirage 2000s to head in the direction of Balakot. By the time they showed up on Pakistani radars, they were 150 km away from the jets that had been scrambled to stop them. The Mirages then acquired the targets in the camps and dropped the SPICE bombs they were carrying.

The strike and the riposte

Five bombs struck the targets, three hitting the large complex housing 150 recruits, one the main U-shaped complex that had most of the leadership and the fifth the building that had the master trainers. One target they could not strike was the abandoned school where Yusuf Azhar resided. That’s because the aircraft chosen to strike it was unable to lock onto the target to release the bomb in the tight window of opportunity. All the aircraft returned safely to their bases that night. Apart from Doval, Dhanoa informed the army and navy chiefs that the mission had been accomplished. All three armed forces went on high alert as they were prepared for retaliation from Pakistan. Meanwhile, the prime minister was informed of the success of the mission. Having ascertained that everyone was safe, Modi proceeded to follow his yoga routine at 4 am.

Only at 11.30 am did India officially acknowledge that it had carried out punitive air strikes. Foreign secretary Vijay Keshav Gokhale read out a terse statement that confirmed that Indian fighter jets had struck a JeM training centre in Balakot and that a large number of trainers and fidayeen were killed as part of a non-military, pre-emptive strike.

Pakistan stoutly refuted India’s claims on the strike’s success and sent a fleet of jets the next day to strike Indian targets. The IAF scrambled its fighters and, in the dogfight that ensued, Pakistan jets struck a MiG21 Bison that crashed in PoK. Its pilot, Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman, was captured after he had bailed out, but India said it had also struck down a Pakistan F-16, a claim that Islamabad refuted. With Pakistan returning Abhinandan 48 hours later, the two nations pushed back from the brink, but kept their armed forces in a state of high alert.

The IAF remains confident that Abhinandan brought down an F-16 before he ejected because the radar monitoring its signature clearly showed it going down. Pakistan, on its part, exhibited the wreckage that it claimed was a MiG 21 engine. However, after a close analysis of the photograph and by stripping down old MiG engines in the Pathankot base, the IAF submitted evidence to the government that the wreckage was not that of a MiG-21 but more likely of an F-16.

In the days after the attacks, the war of words reached a crescendo. In the absence of official figures on how many people were taken out in the strikes, there have only been stray comments by political leaders, including BJP president Amit Shah who put the numbers killed in the JeM camp at 250. Opposition parties demanded that the Modi government show credible evidence of the strikes. There were two ways the air force could validate that they had hit the targets. An airborne platform carrying a Synthetic Aperture Radar, which can take images of the target at night or even if it is cloudy, sent back pictures both before and after the strike, validating the IAF’s claim.

Secondly, the optical satellite pictures took longer coming because the area over Balakot was cloudy for several days. Meanwhile, international news agencies and researchers put out satellite pictures showing there was no visible damage to the targeted camp. INDIA TODAY was shown one of the high-resolution satellite pictures in the IAF’s possession which clearly showed three holes punctured into the roof of one of the buildings a classic signature of a SPICE bomb strike.

Yet doubts remained about how many Jaish members were killed in the strike. According to Indian intelligence, monitored conversations in the area indicated that hours after the strike, the local police station recorded three ambulances with 35 bodies in them coming from the camps. And another 37 ambulances had been rushed to the spot. There were reports of some patients being treated at the Abbottabad hospital.

None of these reports could be corroborated, though, by intelligence agencies. India Today TV recently conducted a sting operation that got on record several people in the area around Balakot confirming fatalities in the air strike. Meanwhile, Pakistan has put a blanket cordon around the camp and is not permitting anyone into the area. This has only fuelled suspicion that it has plenty to hide. Most experts say it will be a while before the death toll can be confirmed.

What is not under doubt is that by striking Balakot, India has sent a clear message that it would make it unaffordable for Pakistan to continue fostering terror. History will tell whether the Balakot strike was the game-changer India needed to get Pakistan to mend its ways.",India,https://www.indiatoday.in/india-today-insight/story/from-the-india-today-archives-2019-balakot-air-strikes-the-inside-story-2724135-2025-05-13,india
26/02/2019,Balakot: Indian air strikes target militants in Pakistan,"India says it launched air strikes against militants in Pakistani territory, in a major escalation of tensions between the two countries.
The government said strikes targeted a training camp of the Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) group in Balakot.
Pakistan said its jets had forced back the Indian planes and denied there were any casualties.
Relations between the countries were strained by a militant attack on Indian troops in Kashmir earlier this month.
India accuses Pakistan of allowing militant groups to operate on its territory and says Pakistani security agencies played a role in the suicide attack on 14 February, which was claimed by JeM and killed 40 Indian troops. Balakot is in Pakistan's north-western Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. Residents there told BBC Urdu they were woken by loud explosions. Pakistan condemned the strike and said it would respond ""at the time and place of its choosing"".
The strikes are the first launched across the line of control - the de facto border that divides India-administered Kashmir from Pakistan-administered Kashmir - since a war between the two countries in 1971.
Both India and Pakistan claim all of Muslim-majority Kashmir, but control only parts of it. The nuclear-armed nations have fought three wars and a limited conflict since independence from Britain in 1947 - and all but one were over Kashmir.What does India say happened?
Indian Foreign Secretary Vijay Gokhale told a news conference that the strikes had killed a ""large number"" of militants, including commanders, and had avoided civilian casualties.
""Credible intel [intelligence] was received that JeM was planning more suicide attacks in India. In the face of imminent danger, a pre-emptive strike became absolutely necessary,"" he said.

India's foreign secretary said the air strikes hit a militant training camp
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi did not directly mention the air strikes when he addressed a political rally in Rajasthan later on Tuesday but he told cheering crowds: ""I understand your enthusiasm and your energy. Today is a day we bow before our heroes.""
India is due to hold elections by the end of May. In Srinagar city, in Indian-administered Kashmir, residents expressed concerns over the spike in tensions. ""Whatever is happening between these two hostile neighbours, it's us who are in the middle of this war theatre,"" Shabir Aakhoon, a banker, said.
Local reporter Sameer Yasir says a heavy military build-up in the past three days has caused panic. Anticipating full-scale war, civilians have stockpiled food and crowded petrol pumps, triggering traffic jams in many places, he adds.

30/07/2019,Triple talaq: India criminalises Muslim 'instant divorce',"ndia's parliament has approved a bill that makes the Muslim practice of ""instant divorce"" a criminal offence.
""Triple talaq"", as it's known, allows a husband to divorce his wife by repeating the word ""talaq"" (divorce) three times in any form, including email or text message.
The Supreme Court declared the practice unconstitutional in 2017.
Supporters say the new measure protects Muslim women. Opponents say the punishment is harsh and open to misuse.
Men found in breach of the new law can be jailed for up to three years.
The bill was first tabled in 2017 but stalled in the upper house of parliament, where some MPs called it unfair.
India's governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) supports the bill, while the main opposition Congress party opposes it. But the BJP doesn't have a majority in the upper house. On Tuesday, the bill was passed by 99 votes to 84 after a number of walkouts and abstentions.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi was quick to celebrate the vote as ""a victory of gender justice"".But others accused his Hindu nationalist BJP of targeting Muslims.
Asaduddin Owaisi, an MP from the opposition All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen party, said the new law was another attack on Muslim identity under the BJP, which has been in power since 2014. What is instant divorce?
There have been cases in which Muslim men in India have divorced their wives by issuing the so-called triple talaq by letter, telephone and, increasingly, by text message, WhatsApp and Skype. A number of these cases made their way to the courts as women contested the custom.
Triple talaq divorce has no mention in Sharia Islamic law or the Koran, even though the practice has existed for decades. slamic scholars say the Koran clearly spells out how to issue a divorce - it has to be spread over three months, allowing a couple time for reflection and reconciliation.
How Muslim women won India divorce battle
The women who challenged triple talaq
Most Islamic countries, including Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Pakistan and Bangladesh, have banned triple talaq, but the custom continued in India, which does not have a uniform set of laws on marriage and divorce that apply to every citizen.
Why is the bill so controversial?
Campaigners and political parties are sharply divided over the bill. Those against it, including some Muslim women, point out that it's unusual to criminalise divorce.
The Congress party and others have pointed out the practice was already outlawed by the country's top court. Others have said the state has no place in regulating the marital home.But those in favour of the bill say triple talaq is deeply discriminatory towards women.
Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad defended the bill, saying the practice had not stopped despite it being banned. He told the Rajya Sabha that some 574 cases were reported after the Supreme Court verdict.
""The judgement has come, but no action on triple talaq has been taken. That is why we have brought this law, because the law is a deterrence,"" he said.
Campaigners say it's almost impossible to quantify how many cases of triple talaq occur in India.",India,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-49160818,india
19/08/2019,"Centre defends law on triple talaq in SC, says practice ‘fatal’ to institution of marriage","The Centre has defended its 2019 law against triple talaq by telling the Supreme Court that the practice is “fatal” to the institution of marriage.
The Supreme Court of India. (HT PHOTO)
In an affidavit filed in response to petitions challenging the law, the Centre has said that despite the Supreme Court setting aside the practice in 2017, it has “not worked as a sufficient deterrent in bringing down the number of divorces by this practice” among community members. The government also said that Parliament passed the law to protect married Muslim women from being divorced through triple talaq.
“The impugned Act helps in ensuring the larger constitutional goals of gender justice and gender equality of married Muslim women and helps subserve their fundamental rights of non-discrimination and empowerment,” the Centre said in its affidavit.
Two Muslim organisations, Jamiat Ulama-I-Hind and Samastha Kerala Jamiathul Ulema have asked the court to declare the law “unconstitutional.”
Jamiat argued in its petition that criminalising a specific mode of divorce for one religion while leaving marriage and divorce in other religions under civil law creates discrimination, which violates Article 15.
On August 22, 2017, the Supreme Court declared instant triple talaq (talaq-e-biddah) unconstitutional. On August 23, 2019, the Court agreed to review the validity of the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, 2019. Violation of the law entails imprisonment of up to three years.
The BJP-led NDA government at the Centre had passed the triple talaq bill in the Upper House with 99 votes in favor and 84 against on July 30, 2019. The scrapping of the practice was a key promise of the BJP.
After struggling to pass the legislation in the Rajya Sabha due to insufficient numbers, the government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi had issued several Ordinances. Under the law, a Muslim woman who has been subjected to triple talaq is entitled to seek a subsistence allowance from her husband for herself and her dependent children. Additionally, she can seek custody of her minor children.",India,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-defends-law-on-triple-talaq-in-sc-says-practice-fatal-to-institution-of-marriage-101724063127286.html,india
