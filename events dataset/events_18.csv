1/1/2018,"Telangana starts free, 24-hour power supply to farmers","The Telangana government on Monday launched a round-the-clock power supply to the stateâ€™s 2.3 million farmers free of cost, but power experts and opposition parties said that the scheme might result in its misuse and large-scale exploitation of groundwater. Transmission Corporation of Telangana Ltd’s chairperson and managing director D Prabhakar Rao and Southern Discom MD Raghuma Reddy formally launched the scheme at Pothaipalli village of Shamirpet mandal in Medchal Malkajgiri district at 12.01am.
Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao described the 24X7 agriculture power supply as a New Year’s gift for the farmers of the state.
“Though certain states are supplying power to farmers free of cost, it is only for a few hours; and some states are giving 24-hour power supply but for a price. Telangana is the only state which is supplying power to farmers round the clock free of cost,” he said.
The free power supply will now be available for 23 lakh agricultural pump sets.  According to Prabhakar Rao, the demand from the agriculture sector in January will be around 9,500 MW, which might go up to 11,000 MW by March.
“Our transmission and distribution system can bear the load up to 17,000 MW. We have strengthened the system at a cost of Rs 12,610 crore in the last three years,” Rao said.
The electricity supply is crucial to farmers who use motorised pumps to irrigate their fields and largely depend on groundwater due to lack of canal irrigation.
Distribution companies at present are able to meet a maximum power demand of 9,500 MW to agriculture sector during peak hours of the day.
Transco officials have said that at least 1,500-2,000 MW of additional power is required to meet increasing demand and implement the free-power programme. However, experts say the round-the-clock power supply scheme might prove counter-productive to the farming community rather than actually benefitting them.
“First of all, nobody has asked for a 24X7 power supply, since farmers do not need more than nine hours of quality power supply to the crops. Secondly, it will result in large-scale exploitation of groundwater resulting in its fast depletion,” a senior official of the Southern Discom told the Hindustan Times on condition of anonymity.
“Thirdly, it will hit small and marginal farmers with small landholdings, as big farmers draw huge water using powerful pump sets,” he added.
The official said if the power supply was given in phases it would help recharge the groundwater but if there is uninterrupted supply it will deplete faster. Since the power supply is free, there is absolutely no control on the exploitation of groundwater using agriculture pump sets, he added.
“Moreover, there is every possibility of misuse of the scheme by some big people by drawing water from agriculture pumps and selling the same in the areas of water scarcity through water tankers,” he warned.
At present, almost all the agriculture pump sets are fitted with auto starters.
“When there was an uncertainty in the power supply in the past, these auto-starters used to help start the pump set whenever the power supply was restored. Now that there is an uninterrupted power supply, these auto-starters continue to run resulting in heavy power consumption,” the Discom official said.
If the farmers do not remove the auto starters, the pump sets continue to draw the groundwater, resulting in its depletion, he added. “The farmers are refusing to remove the auto-starters because if the government fails to continue to the 24X7 power supply scheme and returns to nine-hour supply, they cannot buy the auto-starters again and install them.”
Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee farmers’ cell president M Kodanda Reddy said the scheme was only politically motivated and would not serve the real purpose at all.
“What is the point in giving more power, when there is no groundwater?” Reddy asked.
According to sources in the Telangana groundwater department, its level witnessed an average rise of 4.46 metres below ground level (mgbl) by October end compared to May due to a normal rainfall in 17 districts of the southern state during monsoon.
“However, there are still some districts like Medak, which have registered very low groundwater levels. If the power supply is given round the clock, the water levels by the end of Rabi season in March would go down further,” Reddy pointed out.",Telangana,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/telangana-starts-free-24-hour-power-supply-to-farmers/story-jdQCZIRh1oEzkObm9cC3UN.html
1/1/2018,"Bhima-Koregaon violence: What happened on January 1, 2018","New Delhi: One year on and the memories of last year's violence which erupted in the Bhima-Koregaon village located at the outskirts of the Pune still haven't faded away. 

On January 1, 2018, in this small village of western Maharashtra, violence claimed the life of one person and seriously injured several others, including policemen. The violence erupted when the Dalits members from across the state gathered at Vadhu Budruk, to commemorate 200 year anniversary of the victory of Mahars over Marathas in 1818. The members of the Dalit community congregated at the victory memorial of Bhima Koregaon which was built by the British to pay their tributes to Mahar soldiers who fought for the colonial rulers against the Brahmin Peshwas.

The memorial at Bhima-Koregaon carries a special significance for the Dalit community of the region as the Mahars Dalits fighting under the British defeated the forces of Peshwa Brahmins. Since then the Mahars remember this victory for the Dalits or oppressed class against the ‘practice of untouchability’ perpetrated by the Brahmin Peshwas.

Last year on an unfortunate day, a peaceful assembly consisting of largely Dalits from across the region transformed into violent clashes as soon as members of the ‘Right-wing’ Hindutva group opposed the celebration marking the victory of Dalit soldiers over an army of Peshwas. The members of the Hindutva group were vehemently against the celebration arguing that it was a celebration of “British victory”, according to a report published in NDTV. 

Besides, according to the reports in news agency PTI, the violence allegedly erupted after a group of 'Right-wing' members and some members of the crowd on its way to memorial had an argument. According to an officer posted on the spot, “Stone pelting started after the argument. During the violence vehicles and houses within a vicinity were damaged.” 

Following the violence, the people from the Dalit community led by Bharipa Bahujan Mahasangh, under Prakash Ambedkar, the grandson of the BR Ambedkar, went on a rampage and called for a nationwide bandh on January 3, 2018.",Maharastra,https://www.timesnownews.com/india/article/bhima-koregaon-maharashtra-violence-on-january-1-2018-dalits-versus-right-wing-members-violence-outskirts-of-pune-bharipa-bahujan-mahasangh-prakash/339545
1/2/2018,Hospital Operations Affected As Doctors Go On Nationwide Strike Over New Bill,"This Article is From Jan 02, 2018Hospital Operations Affected As Doctors Go On Nationwide Strike Over New Bill While union Health Miister JP Nadda called the Bill ""beneficial"", the Indian Medical Association (IMA) says it will ""cripple"" the functioning of medical professionals

 Patients had to wait outside hospitals in Kerala where consultation was put on hold in the morning. New Delhi: The outpatient department (OPD) services at private hospitals across the country have remained affected today after the Indian Medical Association (IMA) called for a 12-hour shutdown to protest what it describes as the ""anti-people and anti-patient"" National Medical Commission (NMC) Bill, 2017, that seeks to replace the Medical Council of India (MCI).

""I have spoken to the IMA yesterday. We have heard them...,"" Union Health Minister JP Nadda said in Rajya Sabha during Question Hour today and added, ""This (the Bill) is beneficial to the medical profession.""

The IMA, however, says the Bill will ""cripple"" the functioning of medical professionals by making them ""completely answerable to the bureaucracy and non-medical administrators"".

NDTV has learnt through sources at Max Hospital that doctors who wish to protest can do so between 9 am and 2 pm and patients will be attended by the available doctors. ""We are not turning away patients from our OPD, but yes we are stretched thin today as some doctors are going ahead with the strike,"" said a senior doctor at Max Healthcare.

IMA president Dr Ravi Wankhedkar told NDTV that the shutdown has been a ""success"" in all major hospitals across Delhi and even after the long yearend break, ""important surgeries were postponed to register our protest"".

While services at government hospitals will not be affected, the doctors will observe a 'Black Day' and wear black arm bands as they see patients. Dr Vivek Chouksey, President Federation of Resident Doctors Association, said, ""It is a bill that the politicians are trying to push through and we are against it but we also don't want patients to suffer. So, our OPD services will go on as per routine but we are wearing a black band in protest.""

The IMA, which has 2.77 lakh members, has termed the Bill as anti-poor and anti-people.Doctors in Kerala also stayed off duty and more than 3,000 doctors staged a dharna in front of the Governor's house. While OPD services were suspended at state-run medical colleges in the morning, private hospitals in the state say the protests would continue till 6 pm. Emergency services, however, will be not be affected.

""I was being examined by a doctor and mid way, other doctors came and pulled my doctor away. This is very cruel,"" said a woman from Thiruvananthapuram.

Patients in Karnataka had to wait outside hospitals where consultation was put on hold for the day. Most of the private hospitals won't operate their OPDs till 6 pm today, said HN Ravindra, President of the Karnataka chapter of IMA.

The IMA, which has 2.77 lakh members, has termed the Bill as anti-poor and anti-people, and said it makes the system prone to corruption. It has demanded amendments in the Bill which was tabled in the Lok Sabha on Friday and will come up in Lok Sabha for discussion today.

""The IMA strongly opposes this Bill and has no option but to take the issues to our patients and the people. To register our protest, routine medical services like OPD and elective surgeries across the country have been withdrawn between 6 am and 6 pm at our member hospitals and health institutions,"" national president Ravi  Wankhede had told news agency IANS.

The Bill purported to eradicate corruption, the IMA alleges, is ""designed to open the floodgates of corruption"".

NMC is an anti-poor bill with pro-private management clause, it claimed and added, ""The bill allows ayurvedic as well as homeopathic doctors to practise allopathy after a six-month bridge course.""

""Unscientific mixing of systems and empowering of other practitioners through bridge courses will only pave the way for substandard doctors and substandard medical practice. This will seriously impact patient care and patient safety,"" said the association.

Doctors protest against the National Medical Commission Bill in Delhi.
The IMA has the following demands:

One elected representative in NMC from the Registered Medical Graduates of every state and no separate registration for AYUSH.
The minimum qualification to practice modern medicine shall remain MBBS. No bridge courses to MBBS.
IMA will facilitate deployment of 65,000 fresh MBBS graduates graduating every year in Rural Health Services with appropriate working conditions and incentives.
No licentiate exam after final MBBS examination. IMA proposes common All India Final MBBS examination.
As the new Bill proposes to do away with permissions needed to start a medical college, allowing private medical colleges to increase undergraduate and postgraduate seats on their own, the IMA wants legitimate inspection and appropriate regulation to run a medical college.
The bill allows private medical colleges to decide the fee for 60 per cent of their seats, previously it was 15 per cent. This will increase the cost of medical education.",New Delhi,https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/opd-services-partially-suspended-at-private-hospitals-over-new-medical-law-1794648
2/1/2018,IMA strike today against Medical Commission Bill,"The Bill in its present form was unacceptable and the IMA action committee has declared a “black day” on January 2, said Dr S S Utture, president of the Maharashtra Medical Council. The Indian Medical Association (IMA) has strongly objected to the draft National Medical Commission (NMC) Bill 2017, which was presented in the Lok Sabha on December 29 and will be discussed on January 2. The IMA has announced a nationwide strike between 6 am and 6 pm on January 2 as protest against the Bill, former president of IMA Dr Avinash Bhondwe said.
As the strike has the potential to adversely affect the functioning of government hospitals, the Union Health Ministry has issued an advisory, asking the facilities to ensure smooth running of services. “It has come to the notice that the Indian Medical Association (IMA) would be on one day strike on 2.1.2018…. Since the strike may involve a large number of medical professionals, and it is anticipated that there would be inconvenience to patient care services in hospitals… it is requested that all necessary measures may be taken to ensure that patient health care and patient services are run smoothly,” said the Centre’s advisory.

2-Jan-18,"Bitcoin not considered legal tender in India, says Arun Jaitley","Reiterating the government's stand on cryptocurrencies, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Tuesday said virtual currencies like bitcoin were not considered lawful or legal tender in India, and that the government would wait for an expert panel report on cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum before taking a decisive stand on the matter.""The government does not want to take any substantial steps before the report is filed. We will look into the report and then issue corrective measures after a thorough understanding of the situation. We will also take the global scenario into consideration. However, we have clearly stated that dealing with virtual currrencies is at one's own risk,"" Jaitley said in Rajya Sabha today.

A committee under the Secretary, Economic Affairs Department is examining all aspects of virtual currencies and deciding specific actions accordingly. Instead of taking any knee-jerk action, let's wait for the report of this committee, Jaitley said.

On the other hand, the Finance Minister once again stated that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are not considered legal tender in India. ""Since December 24, 2013, the government and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) have maintained the same stand on bitcoins and other forms of virtual currencies. Through multiple notifications, the two parties have notified the public time and again that bitcoins will not be considered lawful or legal tender in India,"" he said.Jaitley also added that the government has no way to stop terrorists and other criminal outfits from using cryptocurrencies. ""One of the features of cryptocurrency is that there is lack of dependence on the state. It functions with a degree of anonymity. It operates within a virtual community which is created and enjoys the trust of that virtual community,"" he said.

On the question of what the government has done to protect the interest of citizens, Jaitley said that 11 cryptocurrency exchanges have been identified in India. ""Bitcoins are not restricted to India; it is a problem world over. There are 785 VCs in operation worldwide presently. Cryptocurrency lacks dependence and function with anonymity within a virtual community. All operations are online. We have identified 11 exchanges dealing with virtual currencies in India,"" the Finance Minister said.",India,https://www.businesstoday.in/latest/economy-politics/story/bitcoin-panel-files-report-arun-jailtey-rajya-sabha-100181-2018-01-02

""Crypto currencies are not legal tender and the government discourages its use. However, the government will look at the utilisation of Blockchain (a distributed digital technology that supports crypto currencies),"" Jaitley said in his Budget speech in Parliament.
Jaitley has repeatedly said that such digital currencies were not legal tender and people dealing in them would not get any legal protection.

1/6/2018,"Thanks to Demonetization and GST, India's GDP growth hit a 4-year low at 6.5 per cent","India's economic growth in 2017-18 is estimated to drop to a four-year low of 6.5 per cent against the 7.1 per cent in 2016-17. This will be the lowest growth rate under the BJP government, which is largely attributed to the adverse impact of the goods and services tax (GST) and the prolonged effects of demonetization. Central Statistics Office (CSO) on Friday released the first Advance Estimate for India's GDP growth, which showed that the pace of agricultural expansion is expected to fall by more than half (from 4.9 per cent in the previous year to 2.1 per cent in FY18) due to the decline in kharif crop output year-on-year.



Highlights from the Advance Estimate data:

The data also showed substantial rural distress as the agricultural output inflation rate as measured by GDP deflators, is expected to fall to 0.7 per cent against 4.1 per cent over this period. This development may set the direction of the budget, which is less than a month away
The overall GDP growth rate is not only estimated to be lower than what was predicted by the Economic Survey in the range of 6.75-7.5 per cent, but is also just a tad bit higher than the 6.4 per cent registered in 2013-14
However, it is much higher than the 5.5 per cent in 2012-13, a year known for policy paralysis
India may not be the 'fastest growing large economy'

With the drop in the GDP growth, India might lose the tag of being the fastest growing large economy to China if the forecasts of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) come true. The IMF has projected that China will grow by 6.8 per cent in 2017.

GST not only impacted manufacturing in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 when it was rolled out, but also in the first quarter due to pre-implementation jitters
GSt also impacted the net taxes as these are projected to grow only 10.9 per cent in the current financial tear against 12.8 per cent in the previous year.

The GST collection council had cut rates for over 200 items in October and November, which might impact collections.

1/5/2018,GST impact to slowdown India's 2017-18 GDP growth to 6.5% (Roundup),"Implementation of GST and subsequent slowdown in the manufacturing sector is expected to drag down India's growth to 6.5 per cent in 2017-18, official data showed on Friday, even as industry analysts projected economic growth to be higher due to a favourable base effect.
The Central Statistics Office (CSO) projected that economic growth rate for 2017-18 will be lower than the 7.1 per cent achieved in 2016-17.
According to Chief Statistician T.C.A. Anant, the de-stocking disruption caused by the GST implementation has impacted the full-year Gross Domestic Product (GDP) estimates.
The CSO's estimate of national income for 2017-18 showed the GDP at constant (2011-12) prices for 2017-18 is likely to attain a level of Rs 129.85 lakh crore. ""The growth in GDP during 2017-18 is estimated at 6.5 per cent as compared to the growth rate of 7.1 per cent in 2016-17,"" the Ministry of Statistics & Programme Implementation said in its estimate of National Income for 2017-18. Earlier, the country's GDP growth for the second quarter of the current fiscal ended September 30 was 6.3 per cent -- up from 5.7 per cent reported during the first quarter of 2017-18.
The Gross Value Added (GVA), which includes taxes, at basic constant prices (2011-12) is anticipated to increase from Rs 111.85 lakh crore in 2016-17 to Rs 118.71 lakh crore in 2017-18. ""Anticipated growth of real GVA at basic prices in 2017-18 is 6.1 per cent as against 6.6 per cent in 2016-17.""
The data disclosed that sectors like 'public administration, defence and other services', 'Trade, hotels, transport, communication and services related to broadcasting', 'electricity, gas, water supply and other utility services' and 'financial, real estate and professional services' registered a growth rate of over 7 per cent.
On the other hand, growth in the 'agriculture, forestry and fishing', 'mining and quarrying', 'manufacturing' and 'construction' sectors ""is estimated to be 2.1 per cent (from 4.9 per cent), 2.9 per cent (from 1.8 per cent), 4.6 per cent (from 7.9 per cent) and 3.6 per cent (from 1.7 per cent)"", respectively. Number of figures had come in low for the first quarter for the GDP coming in lower at 5.7 per cent because of industry reaction in anticipation of GST (Goods and Services Tax) coming in,"" the CSO said.
Anant said that with more corporate data now being available since the second quarter, including the GST collections for November, although GDP is estimated to growth further, the dampening effect of the first quarter's fall would pull down the grwoth rate for the full year.
He also indicated that the government could find it difficult to achieve its fiscal deficit target of 3.2 per cent of GDP. ""Assuming that budgetary targets will be met, which gave a fiscal deficit of 3.24 per cent, our figures estimate it to be at 3.29 per cent, which rounding off becomes 3.3 per cent,"" he said.
Reacting to the numbers, analysts said they expect GDP growth for the fiscal to go above the 6.5 per cent-mark due to a favourable base effect.
""The advance estimates for the full year have been based on limited data, which would be available for a period of 6-9 months for different sectors. Therefore, they are not fully factoring in the expected pickup in growth in the later months of FY2018, related to a favourable base effect and a 'catch up' following the subdued growth momentum in H1 FY2018,"" said Aditi Nayar, Principal, Economist at rating agency ICRA. ""Accordingly, the advance estimates for GDP and GVA growth appear to be understating economic expansion for FY2018, in our view,"" Nayar said.
""Since these estimates are based on data till November 2017, it has not captured the latest up-tick in the vehicle sales and the improvement in the steel and cement sectors; we expect the final numbers to be revised upwards as and when they happen,"" said Arun Thukral, Managing Director and CEO, Axis Securities.
""Given the tepid growth estimates from agriculture, it gives us a feeling that the budget 2018 will have a higher focus on agriculture and rural economy. And as the estimates are missing the RBI expectations, the central bank is likely to pause in its next policy meeting in February 2018.""",India,https://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ians/gst-impact-to-slowdown-india-s-2017-18-gdp-growth-to-6-5-roundup-118010501259_1.html
12-Apr-18,Asifa Bano: The child rape and murder that has Kashmir on edge,"The brutal gang rape and murder of an eight-year-old girl in Indian-administered Kashmir has put the restive state on edge. Sameer Yasir, an independent journalist based in Srinagar, reports on how the investigation has split the region along religious lines.
On the morning of 17 January, Muhammad Yusuf Pujwala was sitting outside his home in Kathua when one of his neighbours came running towards him. He stopped in front of Mr Pujwala and broke the news: they had found his eight-year-old daughter, Asifa Bano. Her body lay in bushes in the forest, a few hundred metres away.
""I knew something horrible had happened to my girl,"" Mr Pujwala, a 52-year-old with deep sunken eyes, told the BBC in an interview recently. His wife, Naseema Bibi, sat beside him, faintly crying while repeatedly murmuring ""Asifa"".
Mr Pujwala belongs to a community of Muslim nomadic shepherds called Gujjars who crisscross the Himalayas with their goats and buffaloes.
The crime has shocked the community, exposing the fault lines between Hindu-majority Jammu and the Muslim-majority Kashmir valley in a sharply divided state. The Kashmir valley has a tumultuous relationship with India - there has been an armed revolt in the region against Indian rule since 1989.
Was Delhi gang rape India's #Metoo moment?
Viewpoint: How a rape changed India
Police have arrested eight men, including a retired government official, four police officers and a juvenile in connection with Asifa's death.
However, the arrests sparked protests in Jammu - lawyers tried to stop police entering the court to file a charge sheet and two ministers from the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) attended a rally in support of the accused.
The BJP rules the state in a coalition with the regional People's Democratic Party (PDP).
How did Asifa disappear?
When she went missing on 10 January, her family was living in a village around 72km (45 miles) east of Jammu city. On that afternoon, her mother recalls, Asifa went to the forest to bring home the horses. The horses returned but Asifa did not.
Ms Naseema informed her husband. He and some neighbours started looking for her. Armed with flash lights, lanterns and axes, they went deep into the forest and searched through the night. But they could not find her.
Two days later, on 12 January, the family filed a police complaint. But, according to Mr Pujwala, the police were not helpful. One of the police officers, he alleges, said Asifa must have ""eloped"" with a boy.
As news of the crime spread, Gujjar staged protests and blocked a highway, forcing police to assign two officers for the search. One of those who was assigned, Deepak Khajuria, was himself arrested in connection with the crime.
Five days later, Asifa's body was found.
""She had been tortured. Her legs were broken,"" recalled Ms Naseema, who had rushed to the forest along with her husband to see the body. ""Her nails had turned black and there were blue and red marks on her arm and fingers.""
What do investigators believe happened?
On 23 January, six days after Asifa's body was found, the Jammu and Kashmir chief minister, Mehbooba Mufti, ordered a investigation by the crime branch, a special unit of the state police.
According to the investigators, Asifa was confined in a local temple for several days and given sedatives that kept her unconscious. The charge sheet alleges that she was ""raped for days, tortured and then finally murdered"". She was strangled to death and then hit on the head twice with a stone.
Sanji Ram, a 60-year-old retired government officer, allegedly planned the crime with the help of police officers Surender Verma, Anand Dutta, Tilak Raj and Mr Khajuria.
Sameer Yasir Lawyers protest on behalf of the accusedSameer Yasir
Lawyers in Jammu tried to stop police from entering the court to file a charge sheet
Mr Ram's son, Vishal, his nephew, a juvenile, and his friend, Parvesh Kumar, are also accused over the rape and murder.
Investigators allege that Mr Khajuria and the other police officers - some of whom lodged the complaint and accompanied the family in the search - washed Asifa's bloodied and mud-spattered clothes before sending them to a forensic lab.
They believe that the accused men wished to terrorise the Gujjar community into leaving Jammu. The shepherds use public and forest land in Jammu for grazing, which has recently brought them into conflict with some Hindu residents in the region.
""It was about land,"" said Talib Hussain, a tribal rights activist and lawyer. Mr Hussain, who led a protest in support of Asifa's family, alleges he was arrested and threatened by local police.
Ankur Sharma, one of the lawyers who protested on behalf of the accused, alleged that the Muslim nomads were trying to alter the demographics of Jammu, where Hindus are currently the majority. ""They are encroaching our forests and water resources,"" he told the BBC. He said the accused had been falsely implicated while the real culprits were still free.
While the crime did not receive much attention in Jammu, newspapers in Srinagar, the capital city located in the Kashmir valley, carried the story on their front pages.
In Jammu and Kashmir state assembly, Mian Altaf, an influential Gujjar leader and an opposition legislator, waved the newspapers with photographs of Asifa while demanding an inquiry. Rajiv Jasrotia, a BJP lawmaker, said the incident was a ""family matter"" and blamed Mr Altaf for politicising the crime.

What happened at Asifa's funeral?
The Gujjars wanted to bury Asifa in a graveyard where they had purchased some land a few years ago and had already buried five people. But when they arrived there, Mr Pujwala said, they were surrounded by Hindu right-wing activists who threatened them with violence if they were to continue with the burial.
""We had to walk seven miles to bury her in another village,"" Mr Pujwala said. Two of his daughters were killed in an accident some years ago. On his wife's insistence, he adopted Asifa, the daughter of his brother-in-law.
His wife described Asifa as a ""chirping bird"" who ran like a ""deer"". When they travelled, she looked after the herd.
""That made her the darling of the community,"" Ms Bibi said. ""She was the centre of our universe.""

4/17/2018,Accused plead 'not guilty' in Kathua gang-rape case,"Seven men and a minor accused of involvement in the gang rape and murder of eight-year-old girl in Kathua in Indian-administered Kashmir have appeared in a local court.A group of lawyers had earlier tried to block police officials from lodging charges against the accused at a courtroom in Kathua town in Indian-administered Kashmir.

The men charged with the crime pleaded not guilty and asked for a Narcoanalysis (NARCO) test. NARCO is a technique used by Indian investigative officials where the suspect is injected with a dose of “truth serum” or sodium pentothal in an attempt to elicit a confession. “Ideally, the adjudication of a case should happen in an environment which is free from prejudice and bias. In this case, the state of Jammu and Kashmir is already a conflict zone,” Supreme Court lawyer Dushyant told Al Jazeera.

Those accused include policemen who are suspected of destroying evidence.

Sanji Ram, the main accused, said in court on Monday that the charges were a conspiracy against him. Ram was the custodian of the Hindu temple where the victim was held captive and raped by several men for three days before being killed in January this year.

On Monday, the accused also said they wanted the probe to be transferred from the state police to the Central Bureau of Investigation.

“The accused told the court that a NARCO test should be done and they are ready for a NARCO test,” counsel Ankur Sharma told reporters outside the court.

The next hearing is slated for April 28.

Also on Monday, the Supreme Court, while hearing a petition seeking transfer of the trial outside the state, asked the government of Jammu and Kashmir to respond while directing it to provide adequate protection to the victim’s family and lawyer.“This particular case also has very sensitive religious connotations. The lawyers who practise in that court and the bar association have even protested against the charge sheet being filed.

“The Bar and the judges of any court have a delicate relationship. If an influential part of the bar has such strong opinions about how a case should be conducted, it’s problematic. The matter has already taken a political colour. It’s clear that the trial, if it is to be free from bias, should be transferred out of the state and there is ample precedent for this,” Dushyant added.

Deepika Rajawat, the lawyer representing the girl’s family said she is facing death and rape threats from supporters of the accused.

“Today, I don’t know; I am not in my senses. I can be raped, I can be killed and maybe they won’t allow me to practise in court. They (have) isolated me, I don’t know how I can survive,” Rajwat told Indian news agency ANI.

The lawyer in Kathua also said she is branded as “anti-Hindu”.

Activists say Hindu right-wing groups in the state are attempting to divide the state on religious lines.

Hindu groups back the accused
According to details in the charge sheet filed by the crime branch of the Jammu and Kashmir state police, the abduction, rape and killing of the girl was part of a bid to punish the Gujjar Bakarwal nomadic Muslim community to which the victim belonged, and drive them away from Hindu-dominated Kathua.

Protesters affiliated to a Hindu right-wing group, including members of the ruling party the BJP, demanded the release of the accused earlier this year.

Lal Singh and Chandra Prakash Ganga, two ministers from India’s ruling party who attended a rally to support the accused, have since resigned after massive outrage.

The victim’s father, Mohammad Yusuf Pujwala, told the New York Times that he believes his daughter was killed by the Hindu men for the sole purpose of driving her people away.

Following the enactment of tougher anti-rape laws in 2013, rapists in India are liable to life imprisonment and even the death sentence in the rarest of rare cases.

On Sunday, demonstrations against rape and sexual violence were held across Indian cities, New Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru and Trivandrum where many protesters asked for the rapists to be hanged.",Jammu and Kashmir,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/4/17/accused-plead-not-guilty-in-kathua-gang-rape-case
6-Jan-18,"Blast In Jammu And Kashmir's Sopore, 4 Policemen Killed","Srinagar: Four policemen were killed in Jammu and Kashmir's Sopore town on Saturday when an improvised explosive device or IED went off in a market. The attack was aimed at a patrol unit of the police.

The terrorists had planted the remote-controlled IED near a shop in a lane between 'Chotta Bazaar' and 'Bada Bazaar'. It was detonated when the policemen reached the scene while doing their rounds this morning, news agency Press Trust of India reported, quoting officials. Three shops were also destroyed in the massive explosion.

Terrorist group Jaish-e-Mohammad has claimed responsibility for the strike and threatened more such attacks.

""They were on a routine law and order duty in the wake of strike call in Sopore. Three of four fallen policemen belong to the same area of Baramula and Kupwara,"" SA Mujtaba, a senior police officer, told NDTV.

Shops in the market were closed and the area was largely deserted due to a strike called by separatists over the 1993 massacre, in which 57 people were killed in firing by security forces.

Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti expressed her condolences for the families of those killed.



Former chief minister Omar Abdullah tweeted: ""Very sad news from #Sopore. May the four brave J&K police personnel killed in the line of duty today rest in peace.""

On Monday, three terrorists of Jaish-e Mohammad had launched a post-midnight attack at a CRPF training centre in Pulwama. Five security personnel had been killed before the terrorists could be killed in the encounter.

Among the three terrorists was a 16-year-old, the son of a policeman from Kashmir. He was found carrying 24 grenades and a video message that asked young men in Kashmir to join the terror group.

The attack, the police said, was meant to avenge the death of Noor Mohammad Tantray or Chhota Noora, a top terrorist of the group.",Jammu and Kashmir,https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/4-cops-killed-in-kashmirs-sopore-in-improvised-explosive-device-blast-1796555

5/8/2018,Donald Trump declares US withdrawal from Iran nuclear deal,"US President Donald Trump has announced that the United States is effectively withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal, defying last-ditch diplomatic efforts by his European allies to convince him otherwise.“I made clear that if the deal could not be fixed, the United States would no longer be a party to the agreement,” Trump said in a highly-anticipated address on Tuesday. “The Iran deal is defective at its core. If we do nothing, we will know what exactly will happen.

“Therefore, I am announcing today, that the United States will withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal,” he said.

Under the deal signed in Vienna with six world powers – the US, UK, France, Germany, Russia, China and the European Union – Iran scaled back its uranium enrichment programme and promised not to pursue nuclear weapons.

In exchange, international sanctions were lifted, allowing it to sell its oil and gas worldwide. However, secondary US sanctions remain.

The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has repeatedly confirmed that Tehran has been meeting its nuclear commitments fully.

A White House statement issued after Trump’s speech said the US president directed his “administration to immediately begin the process of re-imposing sanctions” related to the deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). The re-imposed sanctions will target critical sectors of Iran’s economy, such as its energy, petrochemical, and financial sectors.”  

‘Foreign policy malpractice’
Trump’s decision fulfills a campaign promise to cancel the 2015 pact, which he has repeatedly described as “the worst deal ever”. Responding to Trump’s announcement, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani attacked Washington’s “empty signatures” and said there was a short time to negotiate with the other world powers to keep the nuclear deal in place.

 “I have ordered the foreign ministry to negotiate with the European countries, China and Russia in coming weeks. If at the end of this short period we conclude that we can fully benefit from the JCPOA with the cooperation of all countries, the deal would remain,” he added.

Thomas Countryman, former US assistant secretary of state who helped negotiate the deal, said withdrawing from the agreement would further thrust the Middle East into the path of instability.

Countryman said with Trump’s decision, the US becomes the first of the seven parties who is violating the agreement. 

“That would be a serious case of foreign policy malpractice, and it would have several effects that would play out very slowly.” He also said the US is now left with diminished credibility to negotiate a better deal, while making negotiations with North Korea “more complicated”.

International reaction
Hours before his speech, the White House said Trump had called French President Emmanuel Macron to discuss his decision. 

Following the announcement, Macron took to Twitter to express the “regret” of Washington’s European allies over the decision.

“France, Germany and the UK regret the US decision to leave the JCPOA,” Macron said. “The nuclear non-proliferation regime is at stake.”

In a joint statement earlier on Tuesday, the European Union, Britain, France and Germany said they met Iranian officials in Brussels and reaffirmed their support “to the continued full and effective implementation of the JCPOA by all sides”.

Meanwhile, Russia warned on Tuesday that a “very serious situation” will emerge if Trump pulls out of the pact.

 
 
‘Call for all-out confrontation with Iran’
Marwan Bishara, Al Jazeera’s senior political analyst, called Trump’s announcement “a major crossroad not only for the Middle East” but also for “international security”.

“I’ve never seen the Middle East closer to the brink of war, a confrontation of sort, than it is today – at least not since the George W. Bush administration went against Iraq and tried to go against Iran.”

Bishara said Trump did not only “alienate his European allies” but his announcement was “a call for an all-out confrontation with Iran” and “a total embrace of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s and of Israel’s logic for the Middle East”.

“In fact, it’s Trump who embraced Netanyahu’s vision of a middle east where a confrontation, a showdown with Iran is necessary for peace and security,” added Bishara. For his part, Ali Fathollah-Nejad, an Iran expert at Brookings Doha and the German Council on Foreign Relations, told Al Jazeera that there is an incentive in Tehran to keep the deal afloat despite Trump’s decision.

He said, “a great portion of the Iranian elite” who benefited from the post-deal business would want the deal to survive.

On the other hand, some hardline factions do not mind the deal’s collapse, he said. 

Since Trump assumed office in January 2017, he had taken several steps to block the deal.

In October, he refused to certify that Iran is living up to the accord. He also targeted several Iranian businesses and individuals with new sanctions.

On January 12, Trump announced he was waiving the US sanctions for the “last time“. He said if his demands to “fix the deal” were not met within 120 days, the US would withdraw from the deal on or before the deadline.",USA,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/5/8/donald-trump-declares-us-withdrawal-from-iran-nuclear-deal
9-May-18,Donald Trump says US will no longer abide by Iran deal â€“ as it happened,"Donald Trump on Tuesday afternoon announced the US would violate the Iran nuclear agreement, nearly three years after the the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) was struck.

In exiting the JCPOA, Trump broke from US allies in Europe and has potentially triggered a new crisis in the Gulf.

We’re closing down the live blog, but more news and analysis is coming this evening. Here’s where things are at now:

Trump justified the exit by claiming that Iran is building a nuclear program, without providing evidence that this is true. “At the heart of the deal was a giant fiction,” Trump said. He used inflammatory language throughout the speech, flinging accusations at Iran though the country has acted in compliance with the nuclear agreement.
He also announced the US will re-impose sanctions against Iran, which will be rolled out in keeping with 90 day and 180 day wind-down periods.
Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani, said “this is a psychological war” and that he believed the agreement could survive if other negotiating partners defied Trump. “I’m happy that the pesky being has left the Barjam,” Rouhani said, referring to the Persian acronym for the deal.
European allies Germany, France and the UK said they had “regret and concern” about Trump’s decision and planned to continue abiding by the agreement.
Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he “fully supports” Trump’s decision. “Israel thanks President Trump for his courageous leadership,” he said.
Former US president Barack Obama, whose administration negotiated the Iran deal, warned Trump’s decision could have dire implications. Obama said: “Without the JCPOA, the United States could eventually be left with a losing choice between a nuclear-armed Iran or another war in the Middle East.”",USA,https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2018/may/08/iran-nuclear-deal-donald-trump-latest-live-updates
11/5/2018,US reinstates tough Iran sanctions amid anger in Tehran,"The United States has reimposed oil and financial sanctions against Iran, significantly turning up the pressure on Tehran in order to curb its alleged missile and nuclear programmes.The move on Monday will restore US sanctions that were lifted under a 2015 nuclear deal negotiated by the administration of President Barack Obama, and add 300 new designations in Iran’s oil, shipping, insurance and banking sectors. Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani vowed to break the sanctions imposed on Tehran’s vital energy and banking sectors.

“America wanted to cut to zero Iran’s oil sales … but we will continue to sell our oil … to break sanctions,” Rouhani told economists at a meeting broadcast live on state television on Monday.

Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Bahram Qasemi told state TV that the new sanctions are part of a psychological war launched by Washington.

“[US President Donald] Trump’s administration is addicted to imposing sanctions … America’s economic pressure on Iran is futile and part of its psychological war against Tehran,” Qasemi told a weekly news conference.

Meanwhile, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the sanctions are intended to convince Iran to “abandon its current revolutionary course”. ""The Iranian regime has a choice: it can either do a 180-degree turn from its outlaw course of action and act like a normal country or it can see its economy crumble,” said Pompeo.We hope a new agreement with Iran is possible but until it makes changes in the 12 ways that I listed in May, we will be relentless in exerting pressure on the regime.

“Rest assured, Iran will never come close to getting a nuclear weapon on President Trump’s watch,” said Pompeo, adding that 19 rounds of sanctions have so far been imposed during the Trump administration. 

Also on Monday, the Belgium-based SWIFT financial messaging service announced it was suspending access for some Iranian banks “in the interest of the stability and integrity of the wider global financial system”.

The US government has previously told SWIFT that it is expected to comply with US sanctions and it could face sanctions if it fails to do so.

Al Jazeera’s Zein Basravi, reporting from Tehran, said the strong talk coming from Iran was a defence strategy.

“Many Iranians we speak to tell us consistently that they have come to learn the only language the US understands is the language of strength.”

Before a campaign rally for the US midterm elections, US President Donald Trump on Sunday said that Iran was already struggling under pressure by his administration. 

“The Iran sanctions are very strong; they are the strongest sanctions we have ever imposed. And we will see what happens with Iran, but they’re not doing very well, I can tell you,” he said.

‘Worst ever’ agreement
Trump announced in May that his administration was withdrawing from what he called the “worst ever” agreement negotiated by the US and reimposed a first round of sanctions on Iran in August.

Other parties to the deal, including Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia, have said they will not leave.

The Foreign Ministry’s Qasemi said Iran is in constant contact with other signatories of the nuclear deal that saw most international financial and economic sanctions on Iran lifted in return for Tehran curbing its disputed nuclear activity under UN surveillance.

“We are in regular contact with other signatories of the nuclear deal … setting up mechanisms to continue trade with the European Union will take time,” Qasemi told a weekly news conference in Tehran.

China, India, Italy Japan, Greece, South Korea, Taiwan and Turkey – all top importers of Iranian oil – are the eight countries granted temporary exemptions from the sanctions to ensure crude oil prices are not destabilised, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced on Monday. Anger in Iran
Earlier, thousands of Iranians rallied to mark the anniversary of the seizure of the US embassy during the 1979 Islamic Revolution.

Addressing the rally in Tehran on Sunday, Iran’s military chief, Major General Mohammad Ali Jafari, warned Trump against overreaching when dealing with Iran.

“I want to say something to America and its weird president,” Jafari said.

“Never threaten Iran, because we can still hear the horrified cries of your soldiers in the [desert] … and you know it better, how many of your old soldiers in American society commit suicide every day because of depression and fear that they suffered in battlefields.

“So, don’t threaten us militarily and don’t frighten us with military threats,” he added.

Over the past year, Tehran has accused Trump of waging “economic warfare” and devastating its economy.

In his speech, Jafari assured the crowd that Trump’s attacks on Iran’s economy were a desperate attempt to defeat the republic and were doomed to fail.

But his optimistic tone stood in stark contrast to the widespread economic chaos Iran has endured during the past 12 months, including a nosedive in the value of its currency, a shake-up of President Hassan Rouhani’s economic team – which saw several senior ministers dismissed – and nationwide protests against price increases and dire economic conditions.

Based on the figures from the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Iran’s petroleum exports hit $52.728bn in 2017. Its crude oil exports stood at 2,125,000 barrels per day during the same year, while its natural gas exports reached 12.9 billion cubic metres.

Those numbers, however, have already dropped in the current year.

In India, for example, crude oil imports from Iran dropped from 690,000 barrels per day in May to around 400,000 barrels per day in August, Vandana Hari, a Singapore-based global oil market analyst, said.

Iran’s energy sector accounts for up to 80 percent of the country’s income from exports, according to the US Energy Information Administration, so a disruption could bring serious pain to its financial bottom line and its people.

Aside from the energy industry, others outfits and activities being sanctioned include:

Iran’s port operators and shipping industry, which is also linked to the transport of oil and gas.
Petroleum-related products and transactions from Iran.
Transactions by foreign financial institutions with Iran’s central bank and other banking institutions.
Insurance and reinsurance institutions, which insure tankers that transport oil and gas.
US-owned or controlled corporations with business activities with Iranian government and individuals.
Individuals, whose named were previously removed from the sanctions list, could also be included.
Iran-related SWIFT transactions could also be flagged.",Global,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/11/5/us-reinstates-tough-iran-sanctions-amid-anger-in-tehran
5-Mar-18,Italian elections 2018 - full results,"The two houses are essentially equally powerful; the approval of both is needed to form a government, for instance. Since no coalition has a majority in either, deals need to be struck if a new election is to be avoided. Seats are awarded by a complex system involving both direct constituencies and proportional representation.
Party-by-party results
The main alliances are made up of several parties; in the case of the centre-right alliance they cover a broad part of the political spectrum: Forza Italia, a fairly traditional centre-right party, was overtaken by Lega, former northern secessionists now more broadly nationalist, while Fratelli d'Italia, a radical right party, also gained share. The strength of the elements within the alliance may affect what deals can be struck in forming a government.

Who are the winners and losers, and what happens next?
Matteo Renzi
Democratic party
Which parties could make up a coalition government?
Several permutations are mathematically possible, but none appear politically easy. Jon Henley explains

Preliminary results from Italy’s general election show the country split three ways. None of the three factions – Silvio Berlusconi’s Forza Italia and the anti-immigration the League; a centre-left coalition headed by Matteo Renzi; and the anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S) – look likely to have enough seats to govern alone, and no government is possible without the support of either the League or M5S.

Some kind of coalition will therefore be necessary for a majority in Italy’s 630-seat parliament. Several permutations are mathematically possible, though none appear politically easy:

Populist and far right: Five Star Movement and the League
Projections have M5S as by far the largest single partywith 231 seats and the League on 123, giving this potential alliance – which would send shockwaves through the EU – a total of 354. Having long rejected all talk of any power sharing, M5S now says it is willing to at least talk about common policies. “We will discuss with all other parties,” its leader, Luigi di Maio, said, adding that the party has “a responsibility to govern”. Many analysts believe the leftwing of M5S would revolt were there a hookup with the League.

Populist, rightwing, far right: M5S, Forza Italia, the League
This combination would have a total of 453 seats, 99 of which would be occupied by from Berlusconi’s Forza Italia. All three parties initially ruled out alternative post-election pacts, but with Forza Italia on course to win fewer seats than the League, a senior official from the latter, Claudio Borghi, has suggested a rightwing alliance headed by his party’s leader, Matteo Salvini, could find an accord with M5S. Salvini appears to have ruled this out, saying he is “committed” to his alliance with Forza Italia, but has stressed the League has “a right and a duty” to govern.

Rightwing and centre left: Forza Italia, the League, the Democratic party
A grand coalition would have a projected 327 seats in parliament, 222 from the rightwing parties and 105 from the Democrats, but bring together some highly unlikely bedfellows in the pro-European centre left and the anti-immigration, EU-critical League. As such, it is seen as highly unlikely. A senior Democratic party official, Ettore Rosato, has said that if results stay as they are, “for us it is a clear defeat and we will move into opposition”.

Populist and centre left: Five Star Movement and the Democratic party
This option, with 336 parliamentary seats, also looks difficult to achieve politically. Matteo Ricci, a former Democratic party vice-president, has said there is “no chance” of it helping the M5S form a government. “The only ally with whom the M5S can form a government is Matteo Salvini , that’s the only option for them,” he said.

Fresh elections
If there is no clear majority, the Italian president, Sergio Mattarella, could choose to leave the current centre-left government of Paolo Gentiloni in place, allowing time to set up a temporary government to organise new elections. That process could only start after parliament meets for the first time on 23 March.
The Democratic party was expecting to do badly, but senior figures admit this is worse even than they feared. Renzi's career has taken another severe knock.

Silvio Berlusconi
Forza Italia

Although part of the biggest coalition, Berlusconi's Forza Italia is not the biggest party within the alliance. That leaves the former prime minister - who is barred from office - short of the electoral authority he needs if he is to act as an eminence grise in the formation of a new government.

Luigi di Maio
Five Star Movement

Despite their protestations, the Five Star Movement did well even in the first-past-the-post seats which are new in this election. As the second force in parliament they could be instrumental in the formation of a government. But to do that they need to set aside their anti-politics stance and do some deals.

Matteo Salvini
Lega

Until recently, Lega was - by design - a strictly regional force. A strong nationwide vote has made it unexpectedly the senior partner in the right-wing coalition, strengthening Salvini's hand in government negotiations.

In the first summit between the two countries since 2007, Kim crossed the military demarcation line at 9:30am (0:30 GMT) on Friday for a meeting in Panmunjom’s Peace House.
Moon briefly stepped into the North as well, in an unscripted moment and at the invitation of Kim.
It is only the third time leaders of the two Koreas have met since an armistice agreement ended the Korean War in 1953, and the first time a summit has taken place in the South.
The truce is still in force and Kim and Moon were expected to discuss a more permanent peace treaty on Friday.
In their first encounter, the leaders seemed relaxed and were smiling.

","U.S., Canada and Mexico just reached a sweeping new NAFTA deal. Here’s what’s in it.","On Sunday night, President Trump got his wish for a significantly revised North American trade deal. After more than a year of intense negotiations, the United States, Canada and Mexico reached an agreement to update the North American Free Trade Agreement, the 1994 pact that governs more than $1.2 trillion worth of trade among the three nations.
The new deal won’t go into effect right away. Most of the key provisions don’t start until 2020 because leaders from the three countries have to sign it and then Congress and the legislatures in Canada and Mexico have to approve it, a process that is expected to take months.
Here’s a rundown of what’s in the “new NAFTA.”
New name. Goodbye NAFTA. The new deal will be known as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA. Trump, who had long disdained NAFTA, had suggested that he might call it the “USMC,” in honor of the U.S. Marine Corps, but in the end, USMCA won out.Big changes for cars. The goal of the new deal is to have more cars and truck parts made in North America. Starting in 2020, to qualify for zero tariffs, a car or truck must have 75 percent of its components manufactured in Canada, Mexico or the United States, a substantial boost from the current 62.5 percent requirement.
Winners and losers of Trump's new trade deal with Canada and Mexico
There’s also a new rule that a significant percentage of the work done on the car must be completed by workers earning at least $16 an hour, or about three times what the typical Mexican autoworker makes. Starting in 2020, cars and trucks should have at least 30 percent of the work on the vehicle done by workers earning $16 an hour. That gradually moves up to 40 percent for cars by 2023.
While many economists think these new rules will help some North American workers, they also warn that car prices might rise and some small cars may no longer be made in North America because they would be too expensive under the new requirements. There are also concerns that automakers might not make as many cars in North America to export to China and elsewhere overseas because costs would be higher in the USMCA region than making the vehicles in Asia.

Trump’s victory: Canada opens up its milk market to U.S. farmers. Trump tweeted often about how unfair he thought it was that Canada charged such high tariffs on U.S. dairy products. Canada has a complex milk and dairy system. To ensure Canadian dairy farmers don’t go bankrupt, the Canadian government restricts how much dairy can be produced in the country and how much foreign dairy can enter to keep milk prices high. Trump didn’t like that, and dairy was a major sticking point in the negotiations.In the end, Canada is keeping most of its complex system in place, but it is giving greater market share to U.S. dairy farmers. U.S. negotiators say they got a major victory by forcing Canada to eliminate the pricing scheme for what are known as Class 7 dairy products. That means U.S. dairy farmers can probably send a lot more milk protein concentrate, skim milk powder and infant formula to Canada (and those products are relatively easy to transport and store).
Canada’s victory: Chapter 19, allowing for a special dispute process, stays intact. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said repeatedly that he wanted to keep Chapter 19 in place, and that’s exactly what happened. The U.S. side pushed hard to eliminate this chapter, but in the end, it stayed.
Chapter 19 allows Canada, Mexico and the United States to challenge one another’s anti-dumping and countervailing duties in front of a panel of representatives from each country. This is generally a much easier process than trying to challenge a trade practice in a U.S. court. Over the years, Canada has successfully used Chapter 19 to challenge the United States on its softwood lumber restrictions.Mexico and Canada get assurance Trump won’t pound them with auto tariffs. Trump has repeatedly threatened to slap hefty tariffs on car and vehicle parts coming from overseas into the United States. Along with the new trade deal, his administration signed “side letters” allowing the two nations to mostly dodge Trump’s auto tariffs.
The side letters say Canada and Mexico can continue sending about the same vehicles and parts across the border free of charge, regardless of whether auto tariffs go into effect down the road. Only parts above that quota could face tariffs.
Trump’s steel tariffs stay in place (for now). Canada wanted Trump to stop his 25 percent tariffs on Canadian steel. That didn’t happen — yet. The two countries are still discussing lifting those tariffs, but a senior White House official said Sunday that process is on a “completely separate track.” Trudeau has called the steel tariffs “insulting and unacceptable” because the two nations are such close allies.
Improved labor and environmental rights. The USMCA makes a number of significant upgrades to environmental and labor regulations, especially regarding Mexico. For example, the USMCA stipulates that Mexican trucks that cross the border into the United States must meet higher safety regulations and that Mexican workers must have more ability to organize and form unions. Some of these provisions might be difficult to enforce, but the Trump administration says it is committed to ensuring these happen — a reason U.S. labor unions and some Democrats are cheering the new rules.Increased intellectual property protections. The new IP chapter is 63 pages and contains more-stringent protections for patents and trademarks, including for biotech, financial services and even domain names. Many business leaders and legal experts believed these updates were necessary given that the original agreement was negotiated 25 years ago.
Big drug companies gain more footing in Canada. U.S. drug companies will now be able to sell pharmaceuticals in Canada for 10 years before facing generic competition. That’s up from eight years of so-called “market protection” now.
Deal must be reviewed after 6 years. The USMCA stipulates that the three nations will review the agreement after six years. If all parties agree it’s still good, then the deal will continue for the full 16 year period (with the ability to renew after that for another 16 years). This was a compromise provision: Trump wanted ability to renegotiate the deal frequently. Ultimately, there will be a review, but it won’t happen until after Trump leaves office. Chapter 11, giving investors a special way to fight government decisions, is (mostly) gone. Chapter 11 is eliminated entirely for Canada and mostly for Mexico, except for some key industries such as energy and telecommunications. Chapter 11 gave companies and investors a special process to resolve disputes with one of the governments in NAFTA. The idea was that if investors put a lot of money into a project and then the government changed the rules, there was a clear dispute process — outside the court system — where investors could get their problem resolved.
Critics argue that Chapter 11 was mainly used as a way for big corporations to get taxpayer money, but businesses say it was necessary to ensure they weren’t harmed by sudden changes when new governments came into power in Mexico, Canada or the United States. In the end, Chapter 11 is mostly gone, except for a few key industries, such as oil, that lobbied hard to be able to challenge the Mexican government if it changes the rules and tries to nationalize its energy sector again.",Global,https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2018/10/01/us-canada-mexico-just-reached-sweeping-new-nafta-deal-heres-whats-it/
1-Oct-18,US and Canada reach new trade deal to replace Nafta,"The US and Canada have reached a new trade deal, along with Mexico, to replace the current North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta).
The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) gives the US greater access to Canada's dairy market and allows extra imports of Canadian cars.
The deal has 34 chapters and governs more than $1tn (£767bn) in trade.
US President Donald Trump, who has long sought to change Nafta, said the new deal was ""wonderful"".
Until recently it looked as if Canada could be excluded from a final trade agreement to replace Nafta which has been in place since 1994.The new USMCA is intended to last 16 years and be reviewed every six years.
Following the agreement, Mr Trump tweeted that USMCA was a ""great deal"" for all three countries and solves the ""deficiencies and mistakes"" in Nafta.The US has been fighting trade wars on several fronts this year, including placing tariffs on steel and aluminium imports from Mexico and Canada, as part of President Trump's America First policy. Tariffs on cars are also threatened.What is in the new deal?
The hundreds of pages of the agreement were released in the early hours of Monday and contain updated arrangements for Canada's dairy industry and measures aimed at shifting lower-paid car jobs from Mexico.
On dairy, US farmers will have access to 3.5% of Canada's $16bn-a-year dairy market.
On cars, Canada and Mexico have a quota of 2.6 million cars they can export to the US as a protection for their car industry if the US imposes a 25% global tariff on car imports
In addition, 40% of car parts of vehicles produced in the USMCA area must be made in areas of North America, paying wages of $16 an hour
On the lumber (or wood) industry, Canada secured protection from US anti-dumping tariffs through the preservation of a dispute-settlement mechanism.

If Nafta trade deal was a hamburger...
How was the deal reached?
The US made a deal with Mexico in August, but relations with Canada over the trade pact had become increasingly strained in recent weeks.
The Trump administration set Sunday as a deadline for Canada to strike a deal.
A protectionist policy under the Mr Trump has seen the US forge ahead with individual trade deals, rejecting bigger multi-lateral trade agreements and posing a challenge to decades of global free trade.
As part of this policy Mr Trump has also launched a trade war against China, which has already hurt companies and could curb global economic growth.A win for Trump?
Andrew Walker, BBC Economics Correspondent
Is this a win for President Trump? He certainly has got Canada and Mexico to agree some important things he wanted.
It will be harder, or at least more expensive, for car makers to use parts from outside North America, notably from China. American dairy farmers are getting better access to the highly protected Canadian market.
There may well be some political benefit for him in the forthcoming Congressional elections.
But he has another wider objective - to reduce the imbalance in US international trade, with individual trade partners and globally.
The US imports more than it exports and President Trump wants to change that. Judging whether he has won in that sense will need more time.
However, many economists don't think trade balances are primarily the outcome of trade policy - instead they reflect government borrowing, private investment and savings decisions and international capital movements.
line
What has been the reaction?
The Canadian dollar jumped to a five-month high and the Mexican peso rose to its highest level for seven weeks on news of the deal.
Meredith Crowley, international trade economist at the University of Cambridge, said the agreement on dairy looked to be a ""cosmetic concession"" so in one way Canada had done well out of the pact.
She said the insertion of a minimum wage level for car parts workers could lead to similar clauses in other trade deals.
""If it turns out to be very politically popular in the US it could [be used again],"" she said,
Canadian dairy farmers were critical. ""We fail to see how this deal can be good for the 220,000 Canadian families that depend on dairy for their livelihood,"" said Pierre Lampron, president of Dairy Farmers of Canada.
However, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said: ""It's a good day for Canada"".
Mexico's Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray said it was a good deal for his country and North America.
The aim is for the agreement to be signed before Mexico's President Enrique Pena Nieto leaves office on 1 December.",Global,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45702609
11/7/2018,Democrats take control of House but Republicans tighten grip on SenateDemocrats take control of House but Republicans tighten grip on Senate,"Democrats have regained control of the House of Representatives, a momentous win in the midterm elections that will enable the party to block much of Donald Trump’s agenda and bombard the president with investigations.

As results came in from across the country overnight, the midterms were a tale of two chambers: the Democrats won key House congressional races while Republicans expanded their majority in the Senate.

The election served as a referendum on Trump’s America, and whether Republicans should remain in absolute power in Washington.

Democrats needed to flip 23 seats to take control of the House of Representatives, and early on Wednesday morning hit the 218 needed to win back the chamber from Republicans, breaking one-party rule in Congress after eight years.

'Blue wave' sweeps Democrats back to majority in House of Representatives

Speaking in Washington, the House Democratic leader, Nancy Pelosi, said the party would use its newly won majority to pursue a bipartisan agenda for a country. Pelosi said Americans have all “had enough of division”.

“Thanks to you tomorrow will be a new day in America,” she said.

Earlier in the evening, the White House spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, sought to downplay Democratic gains, saying: “Maybe you get a ripple, but I certainly don’t think that there’s a blue wave.”

And despite the losses, Trump in a tweet early on Wednesday called the midterm results a “Big Victory”.

But Democrats racked up upsets across the country.

Incumbent Randy Hultgren lost a traditionally Republican suburban district to Lauren Underwood, a 31-year-old African American nurse who ran a campaign focused on healthcare. Military veteran Max Rose pulled off an unexpected win in a conservative district on Staten Island in New York, and the deep red state of Oklahoma elected Democrat Kendra Horn to a district centered around Oklahoma City.

Elsewhere, Democrats Sharice Davids and Deb Haaland made history by becoming the first Native American women elected to Congress. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York became the first woman in her 20s to win a seat and was joined by 29-year-old Abby Finkenauer in Iowa.

It was a record year for women, with at least 90 winning their elections on Tuesday. The majority of them were Democrats, and at least 28 of them were elected to the House for the first time. Voters also sent Congress its first two Muslim women – Rashida Tlaib in Michigan and Ilhan Omar in Minnesota.

However, Republicans extended their control of the Senate, paving the way for a divided Congress.

In one of the most closely watched races, the Republican Texas senator Ted Cruz fended off an unexpectedly tough challenge from Beto O’Rourke, a Democrat who inspired young voters and raised an unprecedented amount of money. O’Rourke mounted the most promising attempt by a Democrat to win a statewide office in Texas in decades, but in the end fell just short of Cruz, who was elected in 2012 on a Tea Party wave and ran unsuccessfully for president in 2016.

The elections carry significant ramifications for what remains of Trump’s first term.

O’Rourke embraces his wife Amy at the election count. He said: ‘Tonight’s loss does nothing to diminish the way I feel about Texas or this country.’

With a majority in the House, Democrats are expected to launch a flurry of investigations into the president and his administration. The White House’s legal team is reportedly bracing for potential inquiries that include whether Trump obstructed justice in the Russia investigation, the misuse of taxpayer dollars by several cabinet officials, and hush money paid to women to keep silent about their alleged affairs with Trump before he was elected president.

“If the Democrats think they are going to waste Taxpayer Money investigating us at the House level, then we will likewise be forced to consider investigating them for all of the leaks of Classified Information, and much else, at the Senate level,” Trump tweeted on Wednesday morning. “Two can play that game!”

The Democratic victory would also stonewall much of Trump’s agenda. Republicans had vowed to pursue further tax cuts and changes to popular government programs, such as Medicare, Medicaid and social security. They also pledged to repeal and replace Barack Obama’s healthcare law, a years-long quest that will assuredly fail with Democrats now holding one of the chambers.

The increased Republican majority in the Senate, however, will make it easier for Trump to continue to appoint judges and remake the nation’s judiciary branch in a more conservative mold.

Four Democratic incumbents lost in the Senate. Three-term incumbent Bill Nelson of Florida lost a tight race to the state’s governor Rick Scott, while two-term Democrat Claire McCaskill lost her re-election bid in Missouri.

Joe Donnelly of Indiana and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota – two Democrats who won in deep red states with Obama at the top of the ticket in 2012 – also lost their re-election bids. All four voted against the controversial confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the supreme court.

In Tennessee, the Republican congresswoman Marsha Blackburn emerged victorious in a contest that drew national attention after the pop star Taylor Swift endorsed the Democratic candidate, Phil Bredesen.

Democrats had been defending 10 Senate seats in states that Trump largely won by double digits two years ago, rendering the battle to win back the upper chamber of Congress an uphill struggle that was ultimately lost.

“To any of the pundits or talking heads that do not give us proper credit for this great Midterm Election, just remember two words – FAKE NEWS!” Trump said in another tweet on Wednesday morning.

Healthcare and immigration were the top issues on voters’ minds as they cast their ballots, according to an exit poll survey conducted by the Associated Press, and 64% of those surveyed said Trump was a factor in their voting choice.

Higher than usual turnout was reported across the country, where 36 governor’s contests reinforced the ramifications of what former president Barack Obama dubbed as perhaps “the most important election of our lifetimes”.

Democrats took several Republican-held governor’s offices, including pulling off a major upset when Tony Evers defeated Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, denying the polarizing Republican and one-time presidential candidate a third term. In Kansas, voters rejected Republican Kris Kobach, a hardline immigration activist who cozied up to Trump, in favor of Democrat Laura Kelly.

But the loss of Andrew Gillum in Florida marked a major disappointment for progressives. His Republican opponent, Ron DeSantis, was a close Trump ally who drew criticism for running what many saw as a racially divisive campaign against the state’s first black major-party candidate for governor.

Gillum, the mayor of Florida’s state capital Tallahassee and a rising star in the Democratic Party, vowed in his concession speech to remain “on the frontlines”.

“We still have to be willing to show up every single day and demand our seat at the table,” an emotional Gillum told supporters.

The fate of Georgia’s governor’s race remained unclear in the early hours of Wednesday, as Democrat Stacey Abrams, who was trailing Republican Brian Kemp by less than three percentage points, said she would not concede.

“I promise you tonight, we are going to make sure every single vote is counted,” said Abrams, who is vying to be the nation’s first black woman governor. Georgia’s voters experienced some of the biggest disruptions and longest waits of the election.

“Democracy only works when we work for it, when we fight for it, when we demand it.”

Democrats have sought to cast the 2018 midterms as a referendum on Trump, whose tenure in the White House has left Americans sharply polarized and has been defined by chaos, tribalism and the shattering of norms.

While crisscrossing the country on behalf of Republican candidates, Trump’s closing argument ahead of the election largely consisted of stoking fears around a caravan of migrants fleeing violence and poverty in Central America and headed toward the US-Mexico border. The president also repeatedly declared that Democrats, if elected, would lead a “socialist takeover” of America.Although a number of Democratic heavyweights hit the trail to stump on behalf of candidates, including Obama, the narrative was still dominated by Trump and his freewheeling rhetoric.

14-Nov-18,Brexit: UK and EU 'agree text' of draft withdrawal agreement,"UK and EU officials have agreed the draft text of a Brexit agreement after months of negotiations.
A cabinet source told the BBC that the document has been agreed at a technical level by officials from both sides after intensive discussions this week.
A special cabinet meeting will be held at 14:00 GMT on Wednesday as Theresa May seeks ministers' backing.
The PM has been meeting ministers in Downing Street for one-to-one talks on the draft agreement.
BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the agreement contained a UK-wide customs ""backstop"" aimed at preventing new border checks in Northern Ireland.


There is no additional Northern Ireland-only backstop - but sources wouldn't be drawn on any specific arrangements for Northern Ireland on rules and regulation within the UK-wide one, she added.
This ""backstop"" has proved to the most contentious part of the withdrawal negotiations, with concerns raised by Brexiteer Tories and the DUP over how it will work.

The pound surged against the dollar and the euro following the negotiations breakthrough - but analysts warned it could be short-lived, with the cabinet and Parliament yet to agree to the plans.
The EU said it would ""take stock"" on Wednesday, while the Irish government said negotiations were ""ongoing and have not concluded"".Leading Brexiteers, such as Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, immediately criticised what has been reported to be in the draft agreement, saying it would keep the UK under EU control.
Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, which gives Theresa May vital support in key votes, said it would be a ""very, very hard sell"".
But Conservative Chief Whip Julian Smith said he was ""confident"" it would pass when put to a crucial Commons vote, and Transport Secretary Chris Grayling called for ""a little bit of calm"" before the cabinet gives its verdict on Wednesday.
Both the UK and EU hope to be able to schedule a special summit of European leaders at the end of November to sign off the deal.
What's been agreed?
The details of the draft agreement have not been published, so we don't know the small print yet.
But it is made up of a withdrawal agreement - said to run to 500 pages - alongside a statement about what the UK and EU's future relationship will look like.
The withdrawal agreement includes how to guarantee there will not be physical border checks reintroduced in Northern Ireland - the major sticking point in recent weeks.
Some Brexiteers fear the likely arrangement will keep the UK locked into EU trade rules for years to come in order to maintain a frictionless border.


The agreement also includes commitments over citizens' rights after Brexit, a proposed 21-month transition period after the UK's departure on 29 March 2019 and details of the so-called £39bn ""divorce bill"". The future relationship statement is expected to be far shorter, with the UK and the EU's long-term trade arrangements yet to be settled.
No 10 said ministers were now being called to a special meeting to ""consider the draft agreement the negotiating teams have reached in Brussels, and to decide on next steps"".
Before they do so, they will be able to read relevant ""documentation"".
line
What does the cabinet do now?
It doesn't seem to me that many of the cabinet are likely to walk on Wednesday over what's in the document.
It's suggested that those with bigger doubts are more likely to cause problems for the prime minister because it won't get through Parliament.
One source told me senior ministers are thinking not just about the wisdom of backing a deal they don't like because it's a sour compromise, but whether it is folly to back a deal they believe can't get through Parliament.
Slamming on the brakes now would force a crisis, but it could be less serious than the political disaster of pursuing this plan to an eventual calamitous defeat that could take them all down.

Who doesn't like it?
Former foreign secretary Mr Johnson said the plan would see the UK remain in the customs union and ""large parts"" of the single market.
He told the BBC it was ""utterly unacceptable to anyone who believes in democracy"" and he would vote against it.
Mr Rees-Mogg warned of the UK becoming a ""vassal state"" with Northern Ireland ""being ruled from Dublin"".

12/27/2018,"Dow up more than 1,000 points in biggest one-day gain ever","Stock markets around the world have staged a post-Christmas rally after shares on Wall Street soared sharply higher after their worst ever performance on Christmas Eve.

After wobbling at the open the S&P 500 Index, the DowJones and Nasdaq had all recorded significant gains by the end of Wednesday. The Dow added over 1,080 points (4.9%), its biggest points gain in history, the S&P rose 4.9% and the Nasdaq, which has suffered the most in recent falls, closed 5.8% up.

Asia Pacific markets followed Wall Street’s lead on Thursday with the Nikkei up 3.9% in Tokyo to take it out of the bear market it entered with a 5% drop on Christmas Day. In Sydney, the benchmark ASX200 index closed up 1.9%.

The FTSE100 is expected to open up 1.5% when trading begins in London later on Thursday.

But analysts said that the fundamental concers of investors about the global economy and trade had not disappeared.

“Investors are aware of negative factors, but they aren’t paying attention to those. They are looking at the Dow’s 1,000 gain,” said Norihiro Fujito, chief investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities in Tokyo.

“I think worries regarding the US government shutdown as well as lack of clarity over whether the US-Sino negotiations (over trade) will go well or not still remain.”

The Dow and S&P 500 dropped more than 2.5% on Christmas Eve, their worst ever pre-holidays performance. Worries about rising interest rates, Donald Trump’s attacks on the Federal Reserve for raising those rates, a government shutdown and the continuing trade tensions between the US and China have all rattled investors and the major indices were on the brink of a bear market – a 20% fall from their most recent high.

US stock markets have enjoyed a record-breaking run, rising steadily since March 2009, the low point of the financial crisis. And the wider economy appears robust with unemployment low and inflation in check. But despite evidence that the US economy remains robust, this year could still mark the first bear market in close to a decade.

On Monday the Dow was off 18.8% from its October high, while the S&P had fallen 19.8% from its record. The tech-heavy Nasdaq index is already in a bear market, down 23.6% from its August record. The soaring share prices of technology companies – especially the so-called Faang companies, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google – helped push stock markets to new highs. There recent losses have been a major factor in dragging the markets down.

With just four more trading days to go until the end of the year, investors are expecting a bumpy ride.

Much of the headwinds have come out of Washington. On Christmas Eve Trump tweeted: “The only problem our economy has is the Fed. They don’t have a feel for the Market, they don’t understand necessary Trade Wars or Strong Dollars or even Democrat Shutdowns over Borders. The Fed is like a powerful golfer who can’t score because he has no touch - he can’t putt!”

The latest attack contributed to Monday’s sell-off and came as economists wrestled with a government shutdown, sparked by Trump’s attempts to fund his border wall with Mexico. That shutdown is now in its fifth day with no signs of a resolution.

Trump has since tried to walk back his criticism of the Fed, telling reporters at the White House on Tuesday that while the Fed was “raising interest rates too fast” he still had confidence in the central bank. “I mean, the fact is that the economy is doing so well that they raised interest rates and that is a form of safety in a way,” he said.

Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York, told Reuters that he expected markets to continue to rally as investors looked for bargains. But he warned there was probably more volatility ahead. “The ‘bear grip’ is feeding on itself as Trump continues to spread uneasiness,” said Cardillo.",USA,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/dec/26/us-stock-markets-post-christmas-sp-500-dow-nasdaq
11/19/2018,Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn's arrest in Japan shocks auto industry,"Carlos Ghosn, the chairman of Nissan and one of the world’s most powerful automotive executives, has been arrested by Japanese prosecutors in a move that sent shockwaves through the industry.

The 64-year-old French-Brazilian is suspected of having understated his income on financial statements and was exposed by a whistleblower. Nissan said it will fire him this week as the company admitted it had left him in control for too long.

Ghosn is regarded as one of the leading figures in the global car industry, having forged an alliance between France’s Renault, Nissan and Mitsubishi that created the world’s second-largest car manufacturer. As well as chairing Nissan, Ghosn is chief executive and chairman of Renault and chairman of Mitsubishi.

In a statement, Nissan said that “over many years” Ghosn and another senior executive, Greg Kelly, had been “reporting compensation amounts in the Tokyo Stock Exchange securities report that were less than the actual amount, in order to reduce the disclosed amount of Carlos Ghosn’s compensation”.

Nissan added: “Numerous other significant acts of misconduct have been uncovered, such as personal use of company assets, and Kelly’s deep involvement has also been confirmed.”

According to Japanese broadcaster NHK and the Kyodo News Service, Nissan paid Ghosn nearly 10 billion yen (£69m) over five years through to March 2015, including salary and other income from the company, but reported as if he only made 5 billion yen, or half of what he had received.

The Asahi newspaper reported that prosecutors had searched the offices of Nissan’s headquarters and other locations on Monday evening.

Hiroto Saikawa, the chief executive and only remaining survivor of the firm’s top three executives, will propose to the board that Ghosn and Kelly be dismissed, citing “clear violations of the duty of care as directors”.

Saikawa confirmed Ghosn and Kelly had been arrested, and apologised profusely to shareholders and employees for the chairman’s conduct. At the end of a 90-minute press conference Saikawa gave a bow of apology.

“Too much authority was given to one person in terms of governance,” he told reporters at Nissan’s headquarters in Yokohama.

“I have to say that this is a dark side of the Ghosn era which lasted for a long time.”

“Beyond being sorry I feel great disappointment, frustration, despair, indignation and resentment,” Saikawa said.


Renault’s market value dived, with shares falling by 8.4%. The value of Nissan shares listed in Germany fell by 6.4%.

The arrest caused consternation across the world, amid concerns that the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance could break apart without the influence of Ghosn. French president Emmanuel Macron said his government, a major shareholder in Renault, “will be extremely vigilant to the stability of the alliance and the group”.

Brazilian-born, of Lebanese descent and a French citizen, Ghosn began his career at tyre manufacturer Michelin in France, before moving on to Renault. He joined Nissan in 1999 after Renault bought a controlling stake and became its chief executive in 2001. Renault owns 43.4% of Nissan’s shares. Nissan, in turn, owns 15% of Renault and 34% of Mitsubishi Motors.

Ghosn was the key figure behind the alliance, which Mitsubishi joined in 2016, creating a top-four car firm through a series of interlinked shareholdings. The alliance, which sold 10.6m cars in 2017, has more than 450,000 employees worldwide including Britain’s biggest car factory, the Nissan plant in Sunderland. Ghosn had signed an extension to his contract at Nissan which would have carried him through until 2022.

In a statement, Renault’s lead independent director, Philippe Lagayette, affirmed his “dedication to the defence of Renault’s interest in the alliance”. The Renault board “will be convened very shortly”, he added.

Mitsubishi in a statement said it would propose Ghosn be dismissed as chairman “promptly”, with his sacking expected on Thursday.

Felipe Muñoz, a global automotive analyst at Jato, a research firm, said the arrest represented a crisis for the firms Ghosn headed, although he added that the alliance could survive.

“We could see some rivalry between Nissan and Renault to take control,” Muñoz said. “[Ghosn] was one of the most important figures in the industry. He was a rock star.”

Ghosn had also in recent months made his mark on British politics, making outspoken comments on the effects of a hard Brexit on Nissan’s Sunderland site. Ghosn was also personally involved in acquiring assurances from prime minister Theresa May that the car manufacturing sector would not be harmed in the aftermath of the Brexit vote in 2016.

Officials at Unite, the union which represents workers at the Sunderland plant, are understood to be monitoring the situation.

Kelly, the other arrested executive, was a representative director at Nissan. A US citizen who trained as a lawyer, Kelly joined Nissan’s North American arm in 1988, including in human resources roles. He was described as the mastermind behind the alleged misconduct by Saikawa.

11/19/2018,Nissan Motors Chairman Carlos Ghosn 'arrested' on financial misconduct charge,"Nissan Motor Chairman Carlos Ghosn was reportedly under arrest in Tokyo on Monday, as his firm accused him of â€œsignificant acts of misconductâ€ and said it would seek to oust him .Japan’s public broadcaster NHK and other media outlets said Mr. Ghosn had been arrested after being questioned by prosecutors for various improprieties, including under-reporting his income.

“The Tokyo District Public Prosecutor’s Office arrested Nissan Chairman Mr. Ghosn on suspicion of violation of the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act,” NHK   said.In a statement, Nissan said it had been conducting a probe into him for several months after receiving a whistleblower report and had uncovered misconduct going back several years.

The Tokyo prosecutor’s office had no comment on the reports about Mr. Ghosn, who also heads an alliance of Renault, Nissan and Mitsubishi.

Nissan said it launched an investigation into both Mr. Ghosn and Representative Director Greg Kelly several months ago.Information given to prosecutors, says company
The company said it had provided information to prosecutors and would propose to the board of directors that it “promptly remove Mr. Ghosn from his positions” along with Mr. Kelly.

The news first emerged on Monday evening, when daiily Asahi Shimbun reported Mr. Ghosn was being questioned by prosecutors and was likely to face arrest.

NHK reported that prosecutors were raiding Nissan’s headquarters in the city of Yokohama. “If he is arrested, it’s going to rock the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance as he is the keystone of the alliance. He is the man of Charisma for the alliance. It is likely to have a negative impact on its brand image,” said Satoru Takada, an analyst at TIW, a Tokyo-based research and consulting firm.

Nicknamed Le Cost Killer, Mr. Ghosn is known for overhauling Renault and Nissan starting in the nineties. Renault came to the rescue of the then-ailing Japanese automaker in 1999 and parachuted in him, who set about slashing costs and jobs in a huge corporate overhaul. In 2016, he also took charge at troubled Mitsubishi after Nissan threw it a lifeline, buying a one-third stake for about $2.2 billion as it wrestled with a mileage-cheating scandal that hammered sales. Mr. Ghosn has a high profile in Japan and is known as a major advocate of the country’s auto sector. He has not yet commented on the allegations.",Japan,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/nissan-motors-chief-carlos-ghosn-arrested-over-financial-misconduct-reports/article25538752.ece
