1/6/2022,"Kazakhstan unrest: From Russia to US, the world reacts","Unrest in Kazakhstan has attracted the attention of the wider region, including neighbouring Russia and China, as well as Western powers.Dozens of people have been killed in almost a week of protests, including citizens and security forces, with frequent and intense clashes in the country’s largest city, Almaty. On Friday, Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev said in an ominous televised address that he had ordered troops to kill demonstrators without warning in the event of further disturbances.

The developments suggest the political crisis in the vast Central Asian nation, which began last weekend with protests against rising fuel prices, could escalate further.

Here is how the world has reacted so far:

Russia
Russia has sent troops to its ally Kazakhstan as part of peacekeeping forces deployed by the Moscow-headed Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) at the request of Tokayev, who has accused foreign-trained “terrorist gangs” of driving the unrest.

According to Eurasianet, this marks the first time CSTO’s collective security provision has been exercised.

Military units from CSTO member states Armenia, Belarus, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan were also being sent, the secretariat said. The organisation, of which Kazakhstan is also a member, has reportedly sent about 2,500 soldiers to Kazakhstan, while Russian military units specifically were being flown in around the clock.

Moscow has said it would consult Kazakhstan on possible further moves to support the counterterrorism operation there and echoed Kazakhstan’s claim that the protests were the result of foreign intervention. “We regard the recent events in a friendly country as an attempt, inspired from the outside, to undermine the security and integrity of the state by force, using trained and organised armed formations,” the Russian foreign ministry said in a statement.United Nations
The United Nations has urged political leaders and protesters in Kazakhstan to refrain from violence.

Speaking to reporters in New York on Wednesday, UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said the world body was monitoring the unfolding situation.

“It’s very important for all involved in these current events to exercise restraint, refrain from violence and promote dialogue,” he said.

On Thursday UN rights chief Michelle Bachelet urged all sides to seek a peaceful resolution to their grievances.

“People have the right to peaceful protest and freedom of expression. At the same time, protesters, no matter how angry or aggrieved they may be, should not resort to violence against others,” Bachelet said in a statement, as she called for the release of all those detained solely for exercising their right to peaceful protest.

European Union
The 27-member European Union has called on Russia to respect Kazakhstan’s sovereignty and independence as Moscow deploys paratroopers to the former Soviet republic.

The European Commission, the bloc’s executive arm, also urged restraint on all sides.

“The violence must be stopped. We are also calling for restraint from all parties and a peaceful resolution of the situation. Now obviously, the EU is ready and willing to support a dialogue in the country,” an EU spokesperson said on Thursday.

Top EU diplomat Josep Borrell said Russia’s military intervention brought back “memories of situations to be avoided”.

Reiterating the bloc’s concerns, European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen and French President Emmanuel Macron called on Friday for an end to the ongoing violence.

“Citizens’ rights and security are fundamental and must be guaranteed. I call for an end to the violence and for restraint. The European Union is ready to help where it can,” von der Leyen told reporters in Paris alongside Macron, who said he agreed with her comments.

United States
Washington said it is “closely following” the situation and called for authorities and protesters to exercise restraint.

“We ask for all Kazakhstanis to respect and defend constitutional institutions, human rights, and media freedom, including through the restoration of internet service,” Department of State spokesman Ned Price said in a statement on Wednesday, citing a reported nationwide internet blackout. “We urge all parties to find a peaceful resolution of the state of emergency,” he added.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki dismissed claims that the US was driving the protests in Kazakhstan – allegations she accused Moscow of spreading.

“There are some crazy Russian claims about the US being behind this, so let me just use this opportunity to convey that as absolutely false and clearly a part of the standard Russian disinformation playbook we’ve seen a lot of in past years,” she told reporters at a news briefing.  China
China’s President Xi Jinping on Friday praised the Kazakhstan government’s deadly crackdown on protesters as “highly responsible” in a message to Kazakh leader Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, state media reported.

“You decisively took strong measures at critical moments and quickly calmed down the situation, showing your position of responsibility and sense of duty as a politician, and of being highly responsible for your country and your people,” Xi told Tokayev in the message, according to the official Xinhua news agency.

United Kingdom
British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said the United Kingdom is “concerned” by the escalating unrest.

Speaking in Parliament on Thursday, Truss said, “Our thoughts are with those who have lost their lives in what has happened, and we condemn the acts of violence and destruction of property in Almaty.”

Truss added the UK government would be “coordinating further” with its allies to decide on possible further steps.

Turkey
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has told his Kazakh counterpart Tokayev that Ankara stands in solidarity with Kazakhstan amid the continuing protests there, the Turkish presidency said.

In a statement issued on Thursday, Erdogan’s office said he had informed Tokayev during a phone call that Turkey was closely monitoring developments and that he hoped tensions would ease as soon as possible, while also offering “all forms of technical information and experience” if needed.

Erdogan also discussed the developments in Kazakhstan with the leaders of Azerbaijan, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan, and said he believed the crisis would be resolved through dialogue, his office said. Belarus
Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko urged protesters in Kazakhstan to end their demonstrations.

During a government meeting on Thursday, Lukashenko said those taking to the streets should reason with Kazakhstan’s president instead, calling Tokayev a “normal person” and “a diplomat who can be reasoned with”.

The Belarusian leader also claimed that the situation in Kazakhstan was a scenario that was avoided in Belarus following a disputed 2020 election that handed him a sixth term in office. Belarus’s opposition denounced the poll as rigged.

France
France has urged restraint from all parties in Kazakhstan, including the troops deployed by the CSTO, and called the reports of bloodshed in Almaty “extremely worrying”.

“We urge all parties – both in Kazakhstan and within framework of the CSTO – to show moderation and open a dialogue,” French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told reporters in Paris on Thursday. Germany
Germany called for de-escalation in Kazakhstan after President Tokayev issued the country’s troops with an order to fire on demonstrators without warning in the event of further disturbances.

“Violence can never be an appropriate response,” government spokeswoman Christiane Hoffmann said on Friday. Hoffman added that Germany was urging all parties involved to “reach a peaceful solution to the situation”.

1/5/2022,Kazakhstan protests: Moscow-led alliance sends 'peacekeeping forces',"“Peacekeeping forces” from a Russia-led military alliance will be sent to Kazakhstan to help the country’s president regain control, it was announced on Wednesday night, as violent clashes continued after fuel price rises triggered widespread protests.

Armenia’s prime minister, Nikol Pashinyan, said the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) – an alliance of Russia, Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan – would dispatch forces to “stabilise” the Central Asian country.

The announcement came after Kazakhstan’s president, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, appealed to the bloc for help, decrying the actions of “terrorists” and alleging the country had been the victim of “attacks” by foreign-trained gangs.

On Wednesday, demonstrators took over government buildings and reportedly stormed the airport in Almaty, the country’s commercial capital and largest city.

“Almaty was attacked, destroyed, vandalised, the residents of Almaty became victims of attacks by terrorists, bandits, therefore it is our duty … to take all possible actions to protect our state,” said Tokayev, in his second televised address in a matter of hours.

The Kazakh events come at a time when all eyes have been on a possible Russian intervention in Ukraine. Images of police being overpowered by protesters are likely to cause alarm in Moscow, as another country neighbouring Russia succumbs to political unrest. Kazakhstan is part of an economic union with Russia and the two countries share a long border.

It was not clear how many troops the CSTO would send and how long they would stay in the country.

There was no immediate comment from the Kremlin, but Russian MP Leonid Kalashnikov told Interfax that the troops would stay “for as long as the president of Kazakhstan believes it necessary”. He said they would mainly be engaged in protecting “infrastructure” in the country.

The announcement came just hours after Dmitry Peskov, Putin’s spokesperson, said it was important no foreign countries interfered in Kazakhstan.

Earlier in the evening, Tokayev spoke to the Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, who crushed a huge uprising with brutal force in 2019. Before calling Tokayev, Lukashenko spoke to Putin, the Belarusian news agency Belta reported.

The protests began in the west of the country at the weekend, after a sharp rise in fuel prices, but have spread quickly and taken Kazakhstan’s authorities and international observers by surprise.

On Wednesday, there were further reports of violent clashes and shooting in Almaty and other cities, as well as unverified videos suggesting casualties among protesters.

Kazakh media outlets cited the interior ministry as saying 317 police and national guard servicemen were injured and eight killed “by the hands of a raging crowd”. There have been no reliable estimates of civilian casualties.

Earlier in the day, the Almaty mayor’s office was set on fire, with smoke and flames visible from several floors of the imposing building. Many flights were diverted or cancelled after the apparent storming of the airport. Kazakh media outlets reported authorities took the airport back under control after a firefight. In other cities, including Aktobe in the west of the country, crowds tried to storm government buildings. There were reports and videos of police cars set on fire and security vehicles seized by the crowd. Tokayev accepted the resignation of the government on Wednesday morning and introduced a state of emergency in several provinces in an attempt to gain control of the situation. Later, the state of emergency was extended to the entire country.

Tokayev also announced that his predecessor and benefactor, 81-year-old Nursultan Nazarbayev, would step down as head of the security council.

Much of the anger has been directed at Nazarbayev, a former Soviet-era communist boss who became Kazakhstan’s first president and ruled until 2019 and who wielded immense power behind the scenes.

“The authorities are trying everything to calm things down, with a mix of promises and threats, but so far it’s not working,” said Dosym Satpayev, an Almaty-based political analyst. “There will be imitations of dialogue but essentially the regime will respond with force, because they have no other tools.” At times, authorities have shut down mobile internet and blocked access to messaging apps, and on Wednesday the internet went down across much of Kazakhstan. Authorities said army units had been brought into Almaty to restore order.

The trigger for protests in Kazakhstan was a sharp rise in the price of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), used by many to power their cars, particularly in the west of the country. Protests began at the weekend in the oil city of Zhanaozen, where in December 2011 police fired on protesters, killing at least 16 people.It soon became clear that the anger was not focused only on LPG prices, and a government announcement that the price would be fixed at a lower level has done nothing to quell the protest.

Instead, there is broader discontent with Tokayev, president since 2019, and Nazarbayev.

“Nazarbayev and his family have monopolised all sectors, from banking to roads to gas. These protests are about corruption,” said 55-year-old Zauresh Shekenova, who has been protesting in Zhanaozen since Sunday.

“It all started with the increase in gas prices but the real cause of the protests is poor living conditions of people, high prices, joblessness, corruption.”

Darkhan Sharipov, an activist from the civil society movement Wake Up, Kazakhstan, said: “People are sick of corruption and nepotism, and the authorities don’t listen to people … We want President Tokayev to carry out real political reforms, or to go away and hold fair elections.”

The five former Soviet Central Asian republics have been largely without protest in their three decades of independence, with the exception of Kyrgyzstan, which has had several revolutions.

Kazakhstan has never held an election judged as free and fair by international observers. While it is clear there is widespread discontent, the cleansing of the political playing field over many years means there are no high-profile opposition figures around which a protest movement could unite, and the protests appear largely directionless.

“There are some local figures, but nobody who could unify forces across the country, though with time they could appear,” said Satpayev.",Kazakhstan,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/05/kazakhstan-protests-president-threatens-ruthless-crackdown
3/9/2022,Russia-Ukraine crisis updates March 08 2022,"Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he is no longer pressing for NATO membership for Ukraine, and that he is open to “compromise” on the status of two breakaway pro-Russian territories that President Vladimir Putin recognised as independent. Russia agreed to create “humanitarian corridors” through a temporary ceasefire in multiple Ukrainian city for the evacuation of the latter’s civilians who are trying to escape amid the military attacks being carried out by Russian forces. Ukraine said, however, that Russia violated the agreement, as shelling was reported on one of the established evacuated corridors.

12/30/2022,"Inflation, tech plunge and ‘crypto winter’: global stock markets in 2022","Investors are reeling from the worst year in global financial markets since the 2008 financial crisis, as inflation forced central banks around the world to raise interest rates and put an end to the supply of cheap money that has fuelled a golden decade for investors.

Global stocks have lost about a fifth of their value during the last year, as the “everything bubble” that inflated during the Covid-19 pandemic burst, sending tech shares and crypto assets tumbling.

Inflation surged as economies reopened from the pandemic lockdowns and Russia triggered an energy crisis in Europe by weaponising gas supplies.Inflation then hit the bond market, which fell into its first bearrun in more than 70 years – with the turmoil after the UK’s mini-budget hammering UK debt and weakening the property sales. Political turmoil also sent the pound reeling to a record low against the US dollar.

“2022 was certainly eventful,” says the Investec economist Philip Shaw.

Equities
The MSCI All-Country World Index of stocks lost about a fifth of its value during 2022, in what Bloomberg calls an “$18tn rout”. That’s the worst performance in 14 years, since the global financial crisis wiped 40% off stock values in 2008.

Europe’s STOXX 600 fell by about 12% in 2022, its worst performance since 2018. But the UK’s FTSE 100 posted a small gain, lifted by energy companies and defence firm BAE Systems.

China’s blue-chip CSI 300 index fell 22% in 2022, as Covid-19 lockdowns hit its economy through the year.The market sell-off wiped almost $1.4tn from the fortunes of the richest 500 alone in 2022, according to the Bloomberg billionaires index.

Shares tumbled as inflation soared, crushing hopes that price rises would be transitory. US consumer price inflation reached a four-decade high of 9.1% in June, and proved stickier than hoped in the autumn too.

Joe Biden dubbed inflation “the bane of our existence”, as food and gasoline prices rocketed. It prompted the US Federal Reserve into its most aggressive rate hikes since the 1990s.FAANGs for nothing
Tech stocks were particularly hit – the Nasdaq Composite lost a third of its value in 2022. The FAANGs – an acronym referring to the big five tech companies, Meta (formerly known as Facebook), Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Alphabet (formerly known as Google) – were far from immune. Apple fell 27%, Amazon’s share price halved, while Facebook owner Meta fell 65% as investors balked at Mark Zuckerberg’s $100bn push into the metaverse.

Tesla also lost about two-thirds of its value in 2022, hitting a two-year low.

Tesla’s shares had a rough end to the year, losing almost 40% in December, hit by fears of slowing demand and concerns that chief executive Elon Musk was being distracted by his purchase of Twitter.“Speculation abounds that the selloff is related to mercurial CEO Elon Musk’s new acquisition of Twitter, ranging from whether Twitter is merely distracting him from his auto company to concerns about his increasingly erratic tweets to worries that Musk is being forced to sell his stake in Tesla in a margin call to support those who bankrolled the Twitter acquisition,” says Matthew Weller, global head of research at City Index.

Bonds
2022 was a historically bad year for European sovereign debt, which was hammered by interest rate rises by the European Central Bank and the US Federal Reserve.

The interest rate, or yield, on German 10-year bunds suffered its biggest selloff going back to the 1950s, according to Refinitiv data.

By the end of September 2022 had been the most devastating period for bonds since at least 1926, according to one estimate.

Investors with classic “60/40” portfolios (60% in shares, and 40% in bonds) were facing the worst returns this year for a century, BofA Global Research warned in October.

The most important take of the year is that “the era of easy money” has ended, and ended for good, says Ipek Ozkardeskaya, a senior analyst at Swissquote Bank.

“We didn’t know it at that time but the 2022 bear market officially kicked off just a couple of days after the year started, when the first minutes release of the year showed that the Federal Reserve was not kidding about the rate hikes, and that the financial conditions would get real tighter over the year,” Ozkardeskaya says.

“And man, they got tighter … way tighter than we expected a year ago, with the Fed raising its interest rates by 425 basis points starting from March,” she adds.Energy
Europe’s energy system faces an unprecedented crisis, although prices have cooled from their highs.Continental gas prices broke new records in August, jumping to €321 a megawatt-hour (compared with €27 a year earlier), after Gazprom announced the closure of its Nord Stream 1 pipeline to Germany for maintenance. The pipeline then remained closed, before then being sabotaged in September.

Despite the disruption, Europe managed to fill its gas storage facilities, helped by an influx of liquid natural gas (LNG). This week, benchmark European gas prices fell back to levels last seen before the Ukraine invasion.

Copper headed for its first yearly decline since 2018, as prices were pushed down by the stronger dollar, fears of a global recession, and the worsening Covid-19 situation in top consumer China. Other industrial metals on the London Metal Exchange were on track for yearly falls, of between 2% and 35%.

But London nickel prices posted the highest gains since 2009, jumping 45% during 2022.

Concerns about disruption to nickel supplies from Russia caused chaotic trading in March. Prices doubled to above $100,000 a tonne in a matter of hours, prompting the LME to suspend trading and annul trades, which then triggered a lawsuit from New York hedge fund Elliott Management. Mini-budget chaos
2022 will also be remembered as the year of the mini-budget crisis. Kwasi Kwarteng’s plans for unfunded tax cuts sent sterling cratering to a record low of about $1.03, and caused a dangerous selloff in government bonds.

The yield, or interest rate, on 30-year UK government debt surged from 3.5% to more than 5% after the mini-budget, as investors sold these gilts, questioning whether Liz Truss’s administration could run a sustainable tax and spending policy.

This created a fire sale, in which some pension funds were forced to offload billions of pounds of UK government bonds, or gilts, at distressed prices.

Some funds came close to collapse before the Bank of England stepped in with a pledge to buy bonds.Crypto

7/7/2022,"Scandal-ridden Boris Johnson resigns, remains UK PM for now","British Prime Minister Boris Johnson resigned Thursday, acknowledging that it was “clearly the will” of his party that he should go. He stepped down immediately as leader of his Conservative Party but plans to remain as prime minister while the leadership contest is held.
He said he has appointed a new Cabinet following a multitude of resignations, but many are calling for him to go now.
It is a humiliating defeat for Johnson, who succeeded in leading Britain out of the European Union and was credited with rolling out one of the world’s most successful mass vaccination campaigns to combat Covid-19.The announcement came after the latest ethics scandal around Johnson’s leadership led some 50 senior lawmakers to quit the government and left him unable to govern.Speaking outside No. 10 Downing Street, Johnson said he was “immensely proud of the achievements of this government,” from Brexit to steering the country through the pandemic, and leading the West in standing up to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. But he acknowledged that “in politics, no one is remotely indispensable.”
Johnson had clung to power for two days, defiantly telling lawmakers on Wednesday that he had a “colossal mandate” from voters and intended to get on with the business of government. But he was forced to concede defeat Thursday morning after two more members of his Cabinet quit and one of his closest allies, Treasury Chief Nadhim Zahawi, publicly told him to resign for the good of the country.
The internal election to pick a new leader of the Conservative Party, who will also be the next prime minister, is likely to take place over the summer.Zahawi, who was promoted earlier this week as Johnson tried to shore up his Cabinet, said he and a group of colleagues had privately expressed their concerns to the prime minister on Wednesday and he decided to go public after Johnson ignored the advice to resign.
“I am heartbroken that he hasn’t listened and that he is now undermining the incredible achievements of this government,” Zahawi said in a letter posted on Twitter. “But the country deserves a government that is not only stable, but which acts with integrity.”
Thursday morning’s resignations meant that 50 Cabinet secretaries, ministers and lower-level officials had quit the government over two days, often castigating the prime minister for his lack of integrity. With more than 20 positions unfilled, the crisis had stalled the business of some parliamentary committees because there were no ministers available to speak on the government’s behalf. Johnson led Britain through Brexit and the Covid-19 pandemic, and won a large election victory in 2019. But the perpetually rumpled leader known for greeting critics with bombast and bluster was also dogged by criticism that he was willing to bend, and sometimes break, the rules to achieve his goals.Johnson, 58, managed to remain in power for almost three years, despite allegations that he was too close to party donors, that he protected supporters from bullying and corruption allegations, and that he misled Parliament about government office parties that broke pandemic lockdown rules.
Recent disclosures that Johnson knew about sexual misconduct allegations against a Conservative lawmaker before he promoted him to a senior position in government proved to be one scandal too many. The crisis began when Chris Pincher resigned as deputy chief whip amid allegations that he had groped two men at a private club. That triggered a series of reports about past allegations leveled against Pincher.
Johnson tried to deflect criticism with shifting explanations about what he knew and when he knew it, but that just highlighted concerns that the prime minister couldn’t be trusted. Health Secretary Sajid Javid and Treasury chief Rishi Sunak resigned within minutes of each other Tuesday night, triggering a wave of departures among their Cabinet colleagues and lower level officials.
Javid captured the mood of many lawmakers when he said Johnson’s actions threatened to undermine the integrity of the Conservative Party and the British government. “At some point we have to conclude that enough is enough,” he said Wednesday in the House of Commons. “I believe that point is now.”",Not Found,https://indianexpress.com/article/world/uk-prime-minister-boris-johnson-resignation-8014555/
7/8/2022,UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson Resigns,"Boris Johnson resigned on Thursday as leader of Britain's Conservative party, paving the way for the selection of a new Prime Minister after dozens of ministers quit his scandal-hit government.
""It is clearly the will of the parliamentary Conservative party that there should be a new leader of that party, and therefore a new prime minister,"" Mr Johnson said outside 10 Downing Street.
Mr Johnson, 58, announced that he would step down after a slew of resignations from his top team in protest at his leadership but would stay on as Prime Minister until a replacement is found.
The timetable for a Tory leadership race will be announced next week, he said, after three tumultuous years in office defined by Brexit, the Covid pandemic and non-stop controversy over his reputation for mendacity.
The leadership election will take place over the summer and the victor will replace Mr Johnson by the party's annual conference in early October, the BBC and others reported.
Boris Johnson faces a parliamentary probe into whether he lied to MPs about ""Partygate"" revelations
He said he was ""sad... to be giving up the best job in the world"" and justified fighting on in the final hours to deliver the mandate he won in a general election in December 2019.
In the frenzied hours building up to Johnson's announcement, opposition Labour leader Keir Starmer had welcomed his impending departure.
But Mr Starmer said ""a proper change of government"" was needed and demanded a no-confidence vote in parliament, potentially triggering a general election, rather than Mr Johnson ""clinging on for months and months"".
Even while eyeing the exit, Mr Johnson on Thursday sought to steady the ship with several appointments to replace the departed cabinet members.
They included Greg Clark, an arch ""remainer"" opposed to Britain's divorce from the European Union, which Mr Johnson had championed.
Mr Johnson had been clinging on to power despite a wave of more than 50 government resignations, expressing defiance late Wednesday.
But Thursday's departure of Education Minister Michelle Donelan and a plea to quit from Finance Minister Nadhim Zahawi, only in their jobs for two days, appeared to tip the balance along with warnings of a new no-confidence vote by Tory MPs.
'No functioning government'
Defence minister Ben Wallace and Rishi Sunak, whose departure as Finance Minister on Tuesday sparked the exodus, were among the early frontrunners to succeed Mr Johnson, according to a YouGov survey of Conservative party members.
Those members will decide the new leader once Tory MPs have whittled down the contenders to a final two.
Boris Johnson had been clinging on to power despite a wave of more than 50 government resignations, expressing defiance late Wednesday.
Northern Ireland minister Brandon Lewis kicked off Thursday's frenzied events, becoming the fourth cabinet minister to resign and writing that Mr Johnson was ""past the point of no return"".
Mr Johnson late on Wednesday defiantly responded to calls from his loyalists and cabinet colleagues to step down by sacking minister Michael Gove, with a Downing Street source telling media that his former Brexit top ally was a ""snake"".
The Sun newspaper said Mr Johnson had told colleagues they would have to ""dip (their) hands in blood"" to push him out of office, but Thursday's events forced his hand.
The shock resignations of Sunak and Health Secretary Sajid Javid late Tuesday set off a chain of others.
They quit after Mr Johnson apologised for his February appointment of senior Conservative MP Chris Pincher as deputy chief whip.
Mr Pincher was forced to step down following accusations he drunkenly groped two men.
Days of shifting explanations followed the resignation, before Downing Street finally conceded that Mr Johnson had known about Mr Pincher's behaviour as far back as 2019.
Tory critics said the Mr Pincher affair had tipped many over the edge, angry at having to defend what they saw as more lies by Mr Johnson over his appointment of what Mr Starmer called a ""sexual predator"".
Mr Johnson was confronted by members of his cabinet on Wednesday when he returned to Downing Street from a lengthy grilling by a parliamentary committee.
The delegation was said to include hardline interior minister Priti Patel.
'Bye, Boris'
Attorney General Suella Braverman told ITV that while she would not resign, ""the balance has tipped now in favour of saying... it's time to go"".
She became the first Tory to say she would stand in a leadership contest but is a rank outsider according to bookmakers.
A culture of scandal has dogged Johnson for months, including lockdown-breaking parties in Downing Street.
The Prime Minister, who received a police fine for the Covid lockdown-breaking ""Partygate"" affair, faces a parliamentary probe into whether he lied to MPs about the revelations.
He only narrowly survived a no-confidence vote among Conservative MPs a month ago, which ordinarily would mean he could not be challenged again for another year.
But the influential ""1922 Committee"" of non-ministerial Tory MPs is reportedly seeking to change the rules, with its executive committee planning to elect a fresh line-up of members next week.
In parliament on Wednesday, Johnson vowed to carry on, insisting the country needed ""stable government"".
But addressing MPs, Javid urged other ministers to resign.
""The problem starts at the top, and I believe that is not going to change,"" he told a hushed House of Commons.

3/9/2022,French presidential election 2022: Here’s everything you need to know,"Sunday’s vote in France is the first round of a presidential election that will determine who runs the European Union’s second-largest economy as the war in Ukraine rages on the bloc’s doorstep.
France presidential election: What happens when?
Some 48.7 million are registered to vote. The candidates who finish first and second go through to a runoff vote on April 24.
– 8 a.m. (0600 GMT): voting starts
– 1000 GMT and 1500 GMT: turnout estimates
– 1700 GMT: voting ends in most places
– 1800 GMT: voting ends in big cities
– 1800 GMT: exit polls are published
– Results trickle in through the evening. By late evening, candidates are expected to have admitted defeat or, for the two leading ones, made speeches to rally voters for the runoff. Who will win France’s election?
Opinion polls favour President Emmanuel Macron to win re-election. But they give him a much narrower edge than when he was elected in 2017 and he is facing stiff competition from the far-right’s Marine Le Pen. Some polls have shown a Le Pen victory within the margin of error.Why does it matter?
The top two candidates, Macron and Le Pen, have very different views of France’s foreign policy and how to deal with Russia, as well as the European Union. They also have very different stances on how to tackle public finances or deal with foreign investors. A Macron win would mean continuity for France, a Le Pen victory would herald major changes.
Now that Britain has left the EU, France is the bloc’s main military power. It’s also the undisputed second-biggest economy in the EU, and Angela Merkel’s exit as German chancellor has given Macron a more prominent role in Europe. A Le Pen win could put France on a collision course with its EU partners. The French political landscape is still feeling the shockwaves from Macron’s 2017 election, and the reconstruction of both the right and the left will very much depend on how the presidential and parliamentary elections pan out.What are the main issues for voters?
Opinion polls show purchasing power is voters’ top concern, amid a huge increase in energy prices and growing inflation. Le Pen has successfully focused her campaign on that.Surveys show voters are unhappy with Macron’s economic policy, but unemployment is at its lowest level in years and those polled don’t think any of his opponents would do better.
How Macron handled the coronavirus pandemic could also play a role, at a time when restrictions have been largely lifted but the number of COVID-19 cases is growing again.
What to watch for
Voter uncertainty. Opinion polls show many are unsure who they will vote for, and turnout could well be much lower than usual, adding more uncertainty.
A potential upset? Polls have for weeks pointed to Macron leading the first round ahead of Le Pen, with both qualifying for a runoff. The far-left’s Jean-Luc Melenchon polls third, a few points behind Le Pen.Deals before a second round. Will the far-right’s Eric Zemmour rally behind Le Pen? Is the “republican front” where whereby mainstream voters end up rallying behind any candidate facing the far-right a thing of the past?",France,https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/france-presidential-election-candidates-key-issues-dates-explained-7861185/

10/31/2022,RBI's emergency meeting: Central bank in tight spot over steep interest rates and rising inflation,"Central banks worldwide are currently facing a tough question: why did their interest rate hike decisions fail to curb rising inflation? The Reserve Bank of India will have to explain its actions (and plan) to the Centre by the second week of November. The bank's monetary policy committee will hold an emergency meeting to prepare the response on Thursday.

The RBI has to explain to the government the uncontrolled price rise for three straight quarters under an inflation-targeting mandate.
The RBI has raised the benchmark interest rate (repo) four times since April 2022.
Despite the hawkish rate hike policy, inflation rose to 7.41 per cent in September 2022.
The current inflation rate is much higher than India's target rate of four per cent.
Inflation is well beyond Parliament's upper tolerance limit of six per cent.
WHY IT MATTERS:

Policymakers face a stark choice - rising inflation will likely keep central banks lifting interest rates rapidly. This could further increase the cost of imports and debt service for many countries, including India. The RBI has to explain the current and future moves to curb inflation by November 12.Experts say that policy rate hikes will continue in the coming days but will be less aggressive and more calibrated. “It is likely to be less aggressive, more data-dependent, and focused on anchoring inflation/inflationary expectations, as opposed to the rate hikes which started in May 2022, to essentially align the policy rate to surging inflation,” India Ratings and Research said on Monday said.

IN NUMBERS:

The RBI has been raising interest rates to curb inflation since May 2022 after inflation touched 7.8 per cent in April 2022, hitting an eight-year high. As a result, the repo rate went up from four per cent in April 2022 to 5.9 per cent on September 30. After that, many banks started to raise their lending rates, either the marginal cost of funds-based lending rate or the repo-linked lending rate. As a result, most lending rates are now at a three-year high in India. The weighted average lending rate, an indicator of all kinds of lending rates of banks on fresh loans, increased by 70 bps from April to August 2022. However, the outstanding loans grew at a slower pace. Private sector banks continued to have the highest rate amongst the three bank groups.

THE BIG PICTURE:

Recently, in its half-yearly update, the Washington-based International Monetary Fund said the ""worst was yet to come"", and a third of the global economy will be in recession next year. The rising cost of living is one of the leading causes behind the downfall of global output.The US, the EU, and the UK have reported inflation reaching levels not experienced since the early 1980s. In most places, high food prices are behind the surge. THE BOTTOMLINE:

India's consumer prices have risen above six per cent since January, hitting an eight-year high in April. When prices go up, people buy fewer of the higher-priced goods. Policymakers see rising risks of high inflation and rising interest rates too. The current inflation trend is likely to keep the RBI lifting interest rates as a single available remedy which has yet to materialise. High prices are a real pain, but rising interest rates will worsen in the coming days.",India,https://www.indiatoday.in/diu/story/rbi-emergency-meeting-central-bank-in-tight-spot-over-steep-interest-rates-and-rising-inflation-2291615-2022-10-31

9/21/2022,"Brace for chill: How La Nina will bring harsh winter, severe cold to India","After one of the heaviest monsoons that triggered multiple cloudbursts, flooding and landslides across India, the country is bracing for a colder-than-average winter this year due to La Nina conditions. It is predicted to be among the strongest of recent years, developing with a 71 per cent likelihood by the end of 2025, according to forecasts from the India Meteorological Department (IMD) and the US Climate Prediction Centre. These conditions will bring severe cold waves, especially across northern India, impacting millions.

La Nina, meaning “Little Girl” in Spanish, is a climate phenomenon characterised by unusually cold sea surface temperatures in the Equatorial Pacific Ocean. It is part of the El Nio-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycle, which alternates between La Nina’s cooling and El Nio’s warming of the Pacific waters. During La Nina, the eastern Pacific near South America experiences cooler waters, while the western Pacific near Indonesia and Australia is warmer. This gradient influences global weather patterns, often causing a temporary global cooling effect.

The cooling of the Pacific Ocean during La Nina changes atmospheric circulation patterns by shifting the jet streams, fast flowing air currents high in the atmosphere, downwards over Asia. This results in an increase in cold wave spells as frigid air penetrates deeper into the northern Indian plains, generating harsh winters and frequent cold waves. India generally benefits from La Nina’s impact as it often brings heavier monsoon rains, which aid agriculture and replenish groundwater.

However, the winters tend to be colder, and in hilly regions receiving snowfall, La Nina can cause heavy snow that disrupts crop production and transportation networks. Despite La Nina’s usual forecast patterns, its behaviour has become less predictable due to the increasing influence of climate change. Rising greenhouse gas emissions create complex interactions that sometimes override typical La Nina effects.

The World Meteorological Organisation recently noted that some regions might experience above-normal temperatures even during La Nina phases, adding uncertainty to long-term forecasts.

While La Nina is expected to benefit Indian agriculture through enhanced monsoons in 2025, it simultaneously raises concerns about extreme cold waves. Experts urge preparedness for the harsh winter ahead, recommending measures to protect vulnerable populations from the cold and emphasising the growing challenges climate change poses in forecasting seasonal weather.La Nina’s return signals a mix of benefits and challenges for India, promising better rains but also bringing the harsh cold that residents must brace for this winter season.",India,https://www.indiatoday.in/environment/story/how-la-nina-will-bring-harsh-winter-severe-cold-to-india-2790138-2025-09-21
3/22/2022,World Water Day | Running out of water and understanding the scarcity's aftermath,"Water scarcity is not a new issue haunting the world; nevertheless, it is still seen as a challenge that affects billions every year. The increasing water demand, coupled with climate change and mismanagement, has made water a scarce commodity, especially in developing countries like India. Scarcity essentially occurs when there is limited availability of a resource in comparison to its demand. Water scarcity can occur due to a variety of reasons, including pollution, inefficient use and climate change. Most of these reasons point back to the destructive actions and habits of human beings and how humans dig their own graves yet again while being around Mother Nature. Two-thirds of the world’s population is experiencing severe water scarcity for at least one month each year, and over two billion people live in regions with inadequate water supply. The countries that face the most water scarcity are in the Middle East and North Africa and include Bahrain, Cyprus, Kuwait, Lebanon, and Oman. These countries use at least 80% of their water supply for domestic needs, industry, livestock, and irrigation. Today, 2.4 billion people live in water-stressed countries, defined as nations that withdraw 25 percent or more of their renewable freshwater resources to meet water demand.",Global,https://www.thehindu.com/children/world-water-day-running-out-of-water-and-understanding-the-scarcitys-aftermath/article69312677.ece

6/27/2022,Monsoon floods devastate Assam again: Here's why this happens and will likely get much worse,"Floods have wreaked havoc on millions of people's lives in the Northeast — especially in Assam — and the neighbouring country, Bangladesh. In recent years, the occurrence of floods has increased globally.

This year, at least 532 people have died so far across the country due to heavy rain and floods during the monsoon season.
Assam is among the worst-hit regions, where the floods’ death toll rose to 127, and millions have been affected.Flood-hit 2,524 villages across 27 districts in Assam.
WHY IT MATTERS

Floods in Assam occur every monsoon (June to September). But this year, the situation has gotten worse. Deadly floods have claimed hundreds of lives and left over five million people struggling daily for food and fresh water, along with the threat of waterborne infectious diseases.

IN NUMBERS

According to the National Flood Commission, around 40 million hectares of land in India are flood-prone, and an average of 18.6 million hectares of land gets affected annually. The annual average cropped area affected is approximately 3.7 million hectares.

During the monsoons in 2020, India experienced a series of deadly floods that claimed 1,282 lives.The most flood-prone areas in the country are in the basins of the Brahmaputra, the Ganga, and the Meghana rivers in the North and the Northeast. Nearly 40 per cent of the total land area of Assam is flood-prone. About nine per cent of the country’s flood-prone land lies in the state and the state faces three to four waves of ravaging floods almost every year.

BIG PICTURE

In 2021, 223 flood disasters occurred globally — almost 37 per cent higher than the average numbers of the last two decades (2001-2020) — according to the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters. However, they were nearly 20 per cent less deadly: 4,143 people were killed in 2021 due to floods compared to the average of 5,185 annual casualties between 2001 and 2020.However, global economic losses due to flooding are estimated to have doubled last year compared to the average annual loss in the previous two decades. India faced around USD 3.1 billion in economic losses last year.

Data shows that India is among the top countries that faced more floods annually with an average of 316 occurrences in the last century (1900-2022), followed by China (311) and Indonesia (256).

BANGLADESH: WORST MONSOON IN 20 YEARSBangladesh is considered one of the world's most climate-vulnerable countries. At least 82 people have been killed, and millions are in need of help after flood water submerged 80 per cent of the Sylhet region in what is arguably the worst monsoon in 20 years.WHY DOES IT HAPPEN EVERY YEAR?

Nearly 75 per cent of the total Indian rainfall is concentrated over a short monsoon season of four months. The rivers witness heavy discharge during these months, leading to widespread floods. Assam has a vast network of rivers which makes the state prone to disasters like floods.

The Brahmaputra and Barak rivers, with more than 50 tributaries, cause flood devastation during the monsoon period. The flood problem in the state is further intensified due to flash floods from rivers flowing down from neighbouring states like Arunachal Pradesh and Meghalaya.

Another major challenge Assam faces is bank erosion by the Brahmaputra and the Barak rivers and their tributaries. According to flood-related government surveys, the Brahmaputra and its tributaries erode almost 8,000 hectares of land every year.

""The Brahmaputra river bed has expanded by a large margin post-Assam earthquake, and when the environmental flows (e-flows) of the river are high, erosion is also extremely high. The river bed expansion is one of the major reasons, but the intensity of floods is high due to the loss of natural ecosystems like wetlands. Managing floods effectively at the basin level calls for hybrid and practical solutions focused on water and soil conservation,"" Abinash Mohanty, Programme Lead, Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW), told India Today.

INCREASING FLOOD RISKExperts say flood risk is increasing due to heavier rains and storms fueled by climate change and other factors like population growth and increased development near coasts and rivers.

India, Bangladesh, and Indonesia, for example, have some of the largest populations affected by riverine and coastal floods each year. By 2030, these three countries will be home to 44 per cent of the world's population annually affected by riverine floods and 58 per cent of the population affected by coastal floods.

""By 2030, the number of people impacted by floods will double worldwide — from 65 million to 132 million due to riverine flooding and from 7 million to 15 million due to coastal flooding,"" the World Resources Institute’s Aqueduct Floods Tool warned.

Experts say that flood risks are related to climate change and this risk needs to be reduced with proper strategy.""Assam has experienced a two-fold increase in extreme flood events in the last five decades. Assam's flood mitigation strategy calls for investing in nature-based solutions and reviving the traditional disaster management practices so that communities can become flood-ready, as riverbed erosion is at an all-time high. Climate-proofing of hard infrastructure will be crucial to flood management plans,” Mohanty further said.

He added, “Further, these plans should be based on granular risk assessments through a Climate Risk Atlas that captures the evolving risk landscapes and helps decision-makers and communities map critical vulnerabilities and plan appropriate strategies.”

10/25/2022,What makes ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2022 different?,"When the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup returned after five years in 2021, it broke viewership records in several regions.  

The India-Pakistan encounter became the most-viewed T20 match in history by clocking a record reach of 167 million viewers, exceeding the previous high of the India-West Indies semi-final match from the 2016 edition of the ICC event held in India.

So are we going to witness another record breaking year?

Namibia pulled off a shock win over 2014 champions Sri Lanka on the opening day of the latest edition of ICC T20 World Cup in Australia that began on 16th October and set to run till November 13th. On the second day, two-time winners West Indies crashed to another shocking 42-run defeat by Scotland.
 
These are indications of the more interesting things to come. The eighth edition of the global showpiece tournament features 16 teams playing 45 matches in seven Australian cities spread across four different time zones. The marquee event will expand to 20 teams in 2024.

With the completion of the qualifying phase, where eight teams battled for four vacant spots, the Super 12s started with a bang in Sydney on Sunday when the hosts met New Zealand in a rematch of last year's final.India were dealt a huge blow with Jasprit Bumrah ruled out due to a back injury. Mohammed Shami, who has not featured in in T20Is since the last T20 World Cup, was drafted as his replacement in the squad. 

India, Australia, England, Pakistan, New Zealand, and South Africa, in that order, are the top favourites this year to lift the trophy. Pakistan have one of the strongest bowling attacks in the world.

Karan Taurani, Senior Vice-President, Elara Capital says, cricket fatigue setting in but T20 World Cup viewership not affected. Digital to get a boost as matches scheduled for Indian afternoon/evening. Overall viewership to be stable unless India underperforms The reigning champions, Australia will look to make the most of home conditions to defend their crown. Australia are also hosting the T20 World Cup for the first time. No host nation has ever won the T20 World Cup and no team has won back-to-back titles in the 15-year history of the world cup. But at the same time, Australia are the first to defend the title at home. 
A number of changes to Playing Conditions by ICC have come into effect on October 1. In a format of small margins, these changes may become match-defining and deciding moments in Australia. The law related to the running out of a non-striker while they back up out of the crease, informally called ‘Mankading’ after former India cricket Vinoo Mankad, has been moved from the ‘Unfair Play’ section to the ‘Run out’ section.

With the normalisation of the practice, especially after Deepti Sharma’s run out of Charlie Dean during India’s tour of England last month, non-strikers will be on their toes. 

A change that came earlier in the year is the in-match over rate penalty. The failure of a fielding team to bowl their overs by the scheduled cessation time leads to an additional fielder having to be brought inside the fielding circle for the remaining overs of the innings.The use of saliva to polish the ball has been permanently banned. Further, when a batsman is out caught, the new one will coming at the striker's end, regardless of whether the batsman crossed prior to the catch being taken.
A new penalty is in place for when the fielding side breaches the law on unfair movement. Any movement deemed unfair and deliberate by fielders while a bowler is running in to bowl now results in the umpire awarding five penalty runs to the batting side, in addition to the delivery being a dead ball.
This time around, India, the world’s top-ranked T20 side, will be looking for a much better showing than their group-stage elimination in 2021.

Speaking to Business Standard, Taurani of Elara Capital says, 2021 WC saw ad revenues of Rs 800-1,000 crore. Marquee events see 15-17% CAGR but growth will be muted this time. New age firms not spending aggressively, they account for 20% of ad spends. Lower TV viewership will impact overall ad revenues negatively.

Elara analyst Karan Taurani says the viewership gap for the tournament between digital and TV is just about 10%.

But because of favourable time zones and mobility restrictions going away, digital viewership could end up crossing TV’s this time. This T20 World Cup will attract an estimated TV audience of 390-400 million and digital audience of 350-400 million. However, TV will still command a higher ad revenue share but viewership growth will be substantially better for digital.
The Australian event follows a run of four T20 World Cups in Asia. As such, fast bowlers will enjoy Australia's bouncy wickets. With more teams better placed than last year, a new host country and interesting rule changes, the fight for the $1.6 million trophy will be anything but a boring affair.
