From this day forward our country will flourish and be respected again all over the world,î he said.


On the first day of his new term, President Donald Trump signed orders ranging from climate to immigration, along with sweeping pardons for many of those who stormed the capital on January 6, 2021.

Some of his orders delivered on promises he made during the 2024 campaign. Others, like a withdrawal from the World Health Organization (WHO), had not been expected. 



Countries across the world are viewing Mr. Trumpís ascension to the White House with a mixture of scepticism and criticism. Some of his executive orders have been received with disapproval. JANUARY 21, 2025 16:35

EU chief Ursula von der Leyen called Tuesday for the bloc to ìdeepenî ties with China and boost relations with India, while taking a ìpragmaticî approach with Donald Trumpís combative new U.S. administration. 
In an opening address to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Ms. von der Leyen emphasised cooperation rather than confrontation with Mr. Trump, who has promised punitive import tariffs on key partners as part of his trade policy. 
ìOur first priority will be to engage early, discuss common interests, and be ready to negotiate,î the commission chief told the gathering of the worldís elites in Switzerland. 
ìWe will be pragmatic, but we will always stand by our principles,î said Ms. von der Leyen, stressing that Europe remained committed to the Paris climate agreement despite Mr. Trumpís order to withdraw the United States from the deal.

His remarks came as the leaders of four major European countries visited Kyiv, amid a push for Moscow to agree to a truce and launch peace talks on ending the nearly three-year war. It coincided with the last day of a unilateral three-day ceasefire declared by Russia that Ukraine says the Kremlinís forces have repeatedly violated.

The announcement comes amid renewed diplomatic efforts to de-escalate the conflict, now nearing its third anniversary, and follows the arrival of leaders from four major European nations in Kyiv to bolster support for peace talks. The proposed truce also coincides with the final day of a three-day unilateral ceasefire declared by Russia, which Ukraine claims has been repeatedly breached by Kremlin forces.Writing on social media platform X, Mr Sybiha said: ìUkraine and all allies are ready for a full unconditional ceasefire on land, air, and at sea for at least 30 days starting already on Monday. If Russia agrees and effective monitoring is ensured, a durable ceasefire and confidence-building measures can pave the way to peace negotiations.î A similar truce proposal was initially put forward by the United States in March, which Ukraine accepted. However, Moscow has thus far refrained from endorsing the terms, reportedly seeking conditions more favourable to its strategic interests.
 
Support for the ceasefire plan has also come from the European Union. President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen lent her backing on Saturday, writing on X: ìWe support the proposal for a full and unconditional 30-day ceasefire. It must be implemented without preconditions to pave the way for meaningful peace negotiations.î She added: ìWe stand ready to maintain strong pressure on Russia and impose further biting sanctions in the event of a breach of a ceasefire.î Russia-Ukraine conflict

The agreements, if implemented, mark a positive step towards a wider ceasefire, which US sees a stepping stone towards peace talks aimed at ending Russia's three-year-old war in Ukraine.However, Russia, has expressed distrust in Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and stated that it would only sign a Black Sea deal if Washington issued an ""order"" to him to respect it.

""We will need clear guarantees. And given the sad experience of agreements with just Kyiv, the guarantees can only be the result of an order from Washington to Zelenskyy and his team to do one thing and not the other,"" Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in televised comments.

Ukraine's defence minister said Kyiv had agreed to both a maritime ceasefire and a pause by Russia and Ukraine in attacks on each other's energy infrastructure.Here's the White House statement on Russia:

""The United States and Russia have agreed to ensure safe navigation, eliminate the use of force, and prevent the use of commercial vessels for military purposes in the Black Sea.

The United States will help restore Russia's access to the world market for agricultural and fertiliser exports, lower maritime insurance costs, and enhance access to ports and payment systems for such transactions.

The United States and Russia agreed to develop measures for implementing President Trump's and President Putin's agreement to ban strikes against energy facilities of Russia and Ukraine.

The United States and Russia welcome the good offices of third countries with a view toward supporting the implementation of the energy and maritime agreements.

The United States and Russia will continue working toward achieving a durable and lasting peace. The United States reiterated President Donald J.

9/10/2025,Maps: Israel has attacked six countries in the past 72 hours," On Tuesday, Israel launched a targeted air strike on a Hamas leadership compound in Qatarís capital, Doha, during a meeting to discuss a US-proposed ceasefire for Gaza.

The strike killed six people, including the son of senior Hamas leader Khalil al-Hayya, the director of al-Hayyaís office, three bodyguards and a Qatari security officer. However, its top leaders are reported to have survived the attack.The attack was part of a wider wave of Israeli strikes extending beyond its immediate borders, and marked the sixth country attacked in just 72 hours and the seventh since the start of this year. Israel continues to bombard Gaza
Israeli attacks across Gaza have killed at least 150 people and injured more than 540 others since Monday.

On Monday, 67 people were killed and hospitals received 320 wounded, including 14 people killed while seeking aid, while six people ñ among them two children ñ died from famine-related causes. On Tuesday, another 83 people were killed and 223 were injured.

Israel is continuing its assault on Gaza City, targeting high-rise buildings, destroying infrastructure, and forcing residents from their homes, leaving many with nowhere safe to seek shelter.Since its onset in October 2023, Israelís war on Gaza has killed at least 64,656 people, including at least 404 who have died of starvation. Thousands more have been lost under the rubble and are believed to be dead.Despite a truce, Israel bombs Lebanon
On Monday at 1:00pm local time (10:00am GMT), Israeli warplanes carried out strikes in the Bekaa and Hermel districts of eastern Lebanon, killing at least five people. Israelís military claimed it had struck weapons depots and military facilities used by Hezbollah, though the assertion could not be independently verified. Hezbollah has not yet issued a response.The attacks marked the latest breach of a ceasefire agreement signed last November.

Despite the truce, Israel has continued near-daily assaults on Lebanese territory, particularly in the south, and maintains an occupation at five border outposts in violation of the ceasefireís withdrawal terms.

On Tuesday, an Israeli drone strike was reported at the entrance of the village of Barja, about 30km (19 miles) south of Beirut, wounding a Hezbollah member.Israel targets Syria
On late Monday night, Israeli warplanes struck several sites in Syria, hitting a Syrian air force base in Homs and a military barracks near Latakia, according to the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR).

Residents reported powerful explosions in Homs and ambulances rushing to the scene in Latakia, though there were no immediate reports of casualties.

Syriaís Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Expatriates condemned the attacks as a ìblatant violationî of its sovereignty and a ìdirect threatî to its national and regional security. State media described the strikes as part of ìa series of aggressive escalationsî by Israel aimed at undermining Syrian sovereignty.

Since the fall of former President Bashar al-Assad in December 2024, Israel has launched hundreds of strikes on military sites and infrastructure across Syria. It has also expanded its presence in the occupied Golan Heights by seizing the demilitarised buffer zone, in violation of a 1974 disengagement agreement with Damascus.

The SOHR reports that Israel has already carried out nearly 100 attacks this year, including 86 air raids and 11 ground assaults, destroying approximately 135 sites and killing 61 people.

Gaza flotilla attacked twice off the coast of Tunisia
On Monday night, the Global Sumud Flotillaís (GSF) main ship, the Family Boat, was struck by a suspected Israeli drone while docked at the Tunisian port of Sidi Bou Said, igniting a fire.

The 23-metre (76-foot) vessel, sailing under a Portuguese flag and carrying the flotillaís steering committee, had six people on board. According to the GSF, the blaze damaged the main deck and storage areas but was quickly extinguished by passengers. All crew and activists were reported as safe.

The Family Boat is part of a coalition of more than 50 vessels with delegates from at least 44 nations seeking to challenge Israelís blockade of Gaza. It departed on August 31, 2025, before joining other ships at Sidi Bou Said port.A second attack followed late on Tuesday night, when another flotilla vessel, the Alma, sailing under a UK flag, was also targeted by a suspected Israeli drone in Tunisian waters. The GSF said the strike caused fire damage to the shipís top deck, though the flames were brought under control and no casualties were reported.

Since 2010, several flotillas have attempted to break the blockade of Gaza, with most being intercepted or attacked by Israel in international waters.

Israel targets Hamas leaders in Qatar
The attack on Qatar, nearly 2,000 km (1,243 miles) from Israel, marks the first time Israel has struck the small Gulf nation, which has hosted multiple rounds of negotiations between Hamas, Israel and the United States.

The explosions were heard across Doha with thick smoke rising above the skyline. Israelís military later confirmed it had struck a compound in the West Bay Lagoon area, a district which is home to foreign embassies, schools, nurseries, supermarkets and residential compounds housing native Qataris and foreign residents.

The Hamas leadership has been hosted by Qatar at the request of the United States, which also has a regional command centre, CENTCOM, located just 35km (22 miles) away from the location of the attack.Israel attacks Yemenís capital
Israel launched an air strike on Yemenís capital, Sanaa, on Wednesday, targeting Houthi positions. The strike hit Sanaa airport, marking the second attack on the site in a month. Israel previously struck Sanaa airport on May 6, destroying its terminal building and badly damaging the runway.

On August 28, 2025, Israeli air strikes targeted a Houthi government meeting in the capital, killing Houthi Prime Minister Ahmed al-Rahawi and several other senior officials.

5/2/2025,Myanmar crisis deepens as military attacks persist and needs grow,"More than a month after two powerful earthquakes devastated Myanmar, the country is spiralling deeper into crisis as continued military attacks, obstructed aid access and widespread displacement leave nearly 6.3 million people in urgent need.
The 28 March quakes killed over 3,800 people and damaged or destroyed more than 55,000 homes across multiple regions, including Bago, Kayin, Magway, Mandalay, Southern Shan, Naypyitaw and Sagaing.

Families already displaced by years of conflict now face early torrential rains, extreme heat and rising risk of disease. Nearly 20 million people ñ more than a third of the population ñ needed assistance even before the earthquakes.

Unremitting violence

Despite the scale of the disaster, High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker T¸rk warned on Friday that the Myanmar military has launched at least 243 attacks ñ including 171 airstrikes ñ since the massive tremors.

Most of the attacks occurred after 2 April, despite both the military and the opposition National Unity Government (NUG) announcing unilateral ceasefires which were largely unobserved.

ìIt is imperative that the military immediately stop all attacks on civilians and civilian objects,î he said in his statement, calling for a genuine and permanent nationwide halt to hostilities and a return to civilian rule.

He underscored the need to put the people of Myanmar first, prioritise their rights, and achieve a peaceful resolution.

ìInstead of further futile investment in military force, the focus must be on the restoration of democracy and the rule of law in Myanmar,î Mr. T¸rk said.

Delays putting lives at risk

UN humanitarians in the country also warn that the situation remains dire.

Speaking to journalists in New York via video link from Yangon, Humanitarian Coordinator ad interim Marcoluigi Corsi said that one month on, people are still living in the open and facing increasingly difficult conditions.

ìThe suffering is immense and the stakes are very high,î he said on Thursday, urging the international community to translate funding pledges into rapid, large-scale support.

ìEvery delay means more lives at risk and more communities in Myanmar struggling to rebuild.î

Lack of funding imperils response

Agencies have reached 600,000 people with water, sanitation and hygiene services. They have also provided nearly 500,000 people with food assistance and over 100,000 with emergency shelter.

But the response remains constrained by severe underfunding.

Mr. Corsi called on donors to urgently disburse their pledged amounts. Without timely action, the crisis would get worse, he warned.

ìLives depend on our collective commitment to delivering the support that is desperately neededÖthe time to act is now,î he said.

The $275 million addendum to the 2025 humanitarian response plan has received just $34 million ñ or about 12 per cent ñ leaving affected communities without assistance.

Disease outbreak risk

According to the UN World Health Organization (WHO) over 450,000 people require critical health services, but only about 33,600 have been reached so far.  

Disease outbreaks are also a growing concern as nine of the 20 townships most at risk for cholera fall within earthquake-affected areas. Stagnant water from delayed rubble removal is creating mosquito breeding grounds, driving up the risk of malaria and dengue.

The ""Sudan conflict (is) taking more dangerous turn for civilians,"" UN Human Rights Commissioner Volker Turk said on social media platform X, adding that ""there is evidence of... war crimes and other atrocity crimes"".

The Sudanese army, at war with rival paramilitaries since April 2023, led an offensive this week on Al-Jazira state, recapturing its capital Wad Madani from the Rapid Support Forces (RSF).

Rights groups said on Monday that at least 13 people including two children were killed in ethnically-targeted attacks against minority communities in the agricultural state.

Though the RSF has become notorious for alleged ethnic-based violence, reports have also emerged of civilians being targeted on the basis of ethnicity in army-controlled areas.

On Thursday, the US treasury department announced sanctions against army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, accusing the army of attacking schools, markets and hospitals, as well as using food deprivation as a weapon of war.

It came a week after the US also slapped sanctions on RSF commander Mohamed Hamdan Daglo, accusing his group of committing genocide.

Responding to recent reports from US officials of the Sudanese army using chemical weapons in Sudan, spokesperson of the UN human rights chief Ravina Shamdasani said Friday that due to limited access, the UN ""has not specifically documented"" such practices during the war.

At a briefing on Friday, Shamdasani described the reports as ""very worrying"", adding that ""they do require further investigation"".

She said what the UN has documented is ""the use of extremely heavy weaponry in populated areas"", including air strikes on marketplaces.Both sides have been accused of targeting civilians and indiscriminately shelling residential areas, with the RSF specifically accused of ethnic cleansing, systematic sexual violence and laying siege to entire towns.

The war has killed tens of thousands, uprooted over 12 million and pushed the country to the brink of famine, creating what the United Nations describes as one of the world's worst humanitarian crises.

In its latest reports, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said that over 120,000 people have fled the ongoing violence in the southern Sudanese states of Blue Nile, White Nile and Sennar to South Sudan since early December 2024.",Sudan,https://www.newindianexpress.com/world/2025/Jan/17/un-says-sudan-war-turning-more-dangerous-for-civilians-after-al-jazira-attacks

  Qatarís Prime Minister said on Wednesday that Israel and Hamas had agreed to a ceasefire in Gaza starting on Sunday and a hostage and prisoner exchange after 15 months of war.

The deal would bring to a pause, a devastating 15-month war in the Gaza Strip and raising the possibility of winding down the the deadliest and most destructive fighting between the bitter enemies. The agreement, coming after weeks of painstaking negotiations in the Qatari capital, promises the release of dozens of hostages held by Hamas in phases, the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners in Israel and would allow hundreds of thousands of people displaced in Gaza to return to what remains of their homes. It also would flood badly needed humanitarian aid into a devastated territory.

The key driver of Thursdayís rally was the announcement of a ceasefire between Iran and Israel, which eased geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, a region closely watched by global markets due to its impact on crude oil prices and energy security. This development boosted risk appetite among investors, resulting in strong buying momentum in Indian equities.

The Bank Nifty index hit a record high, propelled by strong gains in heavyweight HDFC Bank, which continued to show robust quarterly results and stable asset quality.

Energy major Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) played a crucial role, with its market capitalization surpassing the ?20 lakh crore milestone, supported by its diversified business model spanning refining, telecom, and retail.

Broader markets like Nifty MidCap 100 and Nifty Small Cap too mirrored the benchmark indices sliding 0.86% each.

Today's investor caution mainly stemmed from the ongoing assessment of the US-China trade agreement progress, and tensions in the Middle East, especially between US and Iran, lifting global crude oil prices and increasing fears of inflationary pressure

Mixed signals from the US Federal Reserve on the interest rate trajectory also caused market worries.

Today's only sectoral gainer was Nifty Pharma (0.7%) in the morning trade. While the sectoral losers were Nifty FMCG and Nifty Realty, which are 1.0% down due to rate sensitivity and concerns around demand growth weighed on these sectors.

At the same time, a defensive buying trend helped lift pharmaceutical stocks amid global uncertainty.

Top stocks performed today under Sensex were Asian Paints, Bajaj Finserv, Sun Pharma. While, the top losers included Infosys, Eternal, Tata Motors, Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M), and Hindustan Unilever (HUL).

Stocks in Focus

Share prices of Paytm's parent One 97 Communications Ltd declined 10% to ?864.20 today, triggered by a sharp sell-off on high volumes following the Finance Ministryís denial of reports suggesting a merchant discount rate (MDR) being charged on UPI transactions.

Sentiment was hit due to perceived regulatory overhang and profitability concerns in digital payments.

Similarly, Asian Paints witnessed high activity with 35 million shares changing hands in a large block deal during the pre-opening session on NSE.

The stock ended among the top gainers, possibly buoyed by strategic buying amid stable fundamentals.

According to analysts near-term market direction is now likely to be guided by global risk sentiment and oil price trends, any further updates on the US-China trade dynamic, domestic macroeconomic indicators such as inflation data and IIP figures, and movement in foreign institutional investment (FII) flows.
